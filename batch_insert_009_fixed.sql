(''Crude Oil Monthly Forecast: July 2025 (Chart)'',
    ''The month of June was very volatile for the crude oil markets worldwide, as Israel and Iran going to war obviously causes quite a bit of heartburn when it comes to crude oil supply and how people will look at pricing it.That being said, we have since seen the Israelis and Iranians agreed to a cease-fire, and all of that volatility and massive move to the upside has simply rolled right back over.In other words, we have seen the market rally all the way from $65 to the $79 region or so and then drop right back down to the $65 level again. June has been an absolute migraine inducing environment.Are We Recovering Finally?Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewI have a little bit different take on the crude oil market at the moment than most people. What I’ve noticed is that there is a significant amount of hesitation near the $65 level, and that is an area that previously had been significant resistance over the course of about 2 months. The market finding a bit of sideways action in that region makes a certain amount of sense because of the “market memory”, but I also believe that crude oil was trying to break out to the upside before conflict broke out between Iran and Israel. That ended up being the catalyst to really get things moving, but now that we are back where we started, I think they are looking to recover a bit in the month of July.This doesn’t necessarily mean that we take off to the stratosphere, but I think what it means is that the market is going to continue to grind higher more than anything else. Cyclically speaking, this is typically a very positive time of year for crude oil, and unless we get some type of external shock over the next month, it’s likely that we will start to focus on that again. After all, demand picks up in the United States, as well as the European Union during the summer, all things being equal. I am bullish, but I also expected to be a very choppy and slow grind higher.Ready to trade mon'',

    ''Ether (ETH) rallied approximately 20% from six-week lows at $2,100 on June 22 to a high of $2,526 on June 29. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 9% over the last week and 35% over the last 90 days.With a market capitalization of $298 billion, Ether cements its position as the second most valuable cryptocurrency, according to the CoinMarketCap ranking.Apart from the uptrend in the wider crypto market fueled by increased inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs and Bitcoin’s rally to $108,000 over the weekend, other fundamental factors and onchain metrics back Ethereum’s potential to follow in BTC’s footsteps to reach new all-time highs and possibly top out at $10,000 in 2025.Dwindling Exchange SupplyOne factor supporting Ether’s upside is reducing supply on exchanges. Data from onchain market intelligence firm Glassnode shows Ether’s reserve on exchanges reached a nine-year low of 16.15 million ETH on June 23, after dropping 10% over the last 90 days.ETH Exchange Supply. Source: GlassnodeThe total balance between inflows and outflows in and out of all known exchange wallets shows a steep decline since October 2023, when withdrawals from the crypto trading platforms began to surge. This drop accompanies a 130% rise in ETH price over the same period.Decreasing ETH supply on exchanges simply means investors could be withdrawing their tokens into self-custody wallets. This indicates a lack of intention to sell in anticipation of a price increase in the future.This is explained by a spike in accumulation by large holders over the last few weeks. More data from Glassnode shows that wallets holding $100,000 and $1 million or more worth of ETH have been on the rise since the start of April.Number of ETH Wallets with Balances > $100K and $1M. Source: GlassnodeThe chart above shows that wallets holding $100,000 or more have increased from 58,565 on April 8 to 93,000 on June 29.

Gains extended to the 1.1641 resistance level at the time of writing, marking the pair''''s highest point since 2021. The Euro''''s gains increased amid the US dollar''''s weak performance as traders continue to assess the situation in the Middle East. Recently, US President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which eased concerns about potential supply disruptions in the energy sector. However, the truce is being tested as Israel has already accused Iran of violating the agreement.On the economic front, business sentiment in Germany improved, according to the Ifo Index, reaching its highest level in almost a year. However, preliminary PMI indicators painted a mixed picture, with private sector activity in the Eurozone showing signs of stabilization. Meanwhile, concerning monetary policy, analysts still expect a 25-basis-point interest rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB) before the end of the year. For her part, ECB Governor Lagarde stated that "at current interest rate levels, we believe we are well-positioned to navigate uncertain conditions," while Governing Council member Villeroy de Galhau said the ECB could still cut rates in the first half of next year.Trading Advice:Despite the gains, we still advise selling the Euro against the US Dollar from every upward level, but without taking risks, while closely monitoring f'',

The EUR/USD pair reached its peak at 1.1665, and from that high, we activated our free trading recommendation to sell.

Tehran and Tel Aviv had agreed to a temporary ceasefire after exchanging strikes since last week. However, reports of fresh missile launch, and strike orders raised scepticism about the truce''''s validity and fuelled concerns that the conflict would soon resume.Furthermore, this occurred after the exchange of controlled strikes between Iran and the United States minimized collateral damage and preceded a period of apparent de-escalation. This reduced gold''''s appeal as a safe haven and prevented its price from retesting record highs of $3,500 in late April.

Furthermore, we are starting to see the US dollar stiffen it’s resolve against the basket of major currencies that we typically followed.

The market breaking above the $65 level is a very positive sign, so I will be watching that this week. A move above could open up a move to the $68 level, possibly even the $72.50 level.

    ''EUR/USDThe euro rallied a bit during the trading week, breaking above the 1.16 level, but we have given back some of the gains after the Israeli airstrikes on the Iranian regime. This of course has people running toward safety currency such as the US dollar, so it does make sense that we have seen hesitation. However, earlier in the week we had seen quite a bit of bullish pressure, so one would have to assume that there is at least some demand out there for the euro. I suspect the next couple of weeks will be very violent but may have a bit of a bid for them.USD/MXNThe US dollar spent most of the week falling against the Mexican peso, but turned around after the airstrikes, and because of this we are sitting right at the 200 Week EMA. We are also at the crucial 19 MXN level, so if we were to bounce from here it would make a certain amount of sense, but I see a lot of resistance near the 19.40 MXN level, so whether or not it is going to truly rally remains to be seen, I think that could be an area where we could see some issue. A break above the 50 Week EMA could send this pair to the 20 MXN level.GBP/USDThe British pound has been all over the place during the week, as we continue to see a lot of questions asked of the US dollar. That being said, after the airstrikes on Friday, we have seen a little bit of a pushback against risk-taking, so it’ll be interesting to see how this plays out. Ultimately, I think we have a scenario where traders will be looking at this through the prism of risk appetite, and right now we are currently trading in a range between the 1.34 level on the bottom and the 1.3650 level on the top.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewAUD/USDThe Australian dollar traders have seen the market go back and forth during the course of the week as we continue to watch the 0.6550 level as a massive barrier.
