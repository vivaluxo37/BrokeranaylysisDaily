    ''Ripple Labs initiated its business in 2012 under the name of Opencoin. XRP has been traded with solid volume since it started to make formal agreements with financial institutions. Ripple Labs started with the promise of providing its users a revolutionary payment protocols system for banking transactions with quicker times to settle the transfer of funds at cheaper costs.The value of XRP/USD has been very volatile since 2017. My Ripple price prediction for 2025 sees the coin trading between $1.15 and $8. By the year 2030 Ripple could be valued between $6 and $15. These forecasts are based on market sentiment and the utilitarian capabilities of Ripple via its XRP coin.The XRP/USD coin’s primary use is making the clearing of funds easier for financial institutions and businesses associated with them. XRP/USD not a ''''standard'''' cryptocurrency like many of its major counterparts, the distributed ledger from Ripple is internal. Ripple Labs coding is ‘open source’, but XRP/USD uses a centralized system in which Ripple controls the allocation of the XRT coins, sometimes to the dismay of its skeptics.The fact that XRP/USD is centralized has become not only a ‘concern’ for many cryptocurrency influencers, but has also created a legal argument with the SEC. The Security Exchange Commission has in essence declared they believe the XRT coin is a ‘secured asset’, which would mean it has legal oversight domain. An official lawsuit was initiated by the SEC in December of 2020 against Ripple Labs and some of its executives. A contested fight within the U.S court system is anticipated.Is Ripple Undervalued?Ripple''''s XRP coin does not have an unlimited supply. The initial minting of XRP coins was said to be 100 billion. The current price of XRP/USD is near $0.67 cents. In early April 2021, XRP/USD was trading within sight of $2.00 as the broad cryptocurrency market enjoyed a heightened state of exuberance.The fall to its current price level has XRP/USD testing important support values'',

(''A Long-Term Litecoin Price Prediction for 2025'',
    ''Litecoin HistoryLitecoin entered the world of cryptocurrency with a rather impressive start when digital assets began to find favor with speculators and investors throughout the globe. There was a time when LTC/USD was rated within the top 5 of cryptocurrency market capitalizations as its proponents argued positively regarding its merits compared to the likes of Bitcoin. This caused a groundswell of support as people asked what the price of Litecoin would be several years in the future.Litecoin was essentially created in 2011. However the digital asset began trading in earnest with wide market interest in 2017 like many of its major counterparts, when cryptocurrencies jumped into the spotlight as their speculative gains caught the attention of the financial media. Like the other major cryptocurrencies, LTC/USD essentially went from a speculative asset few had ever heard of in early 2017 with a value of little more than nothing, to a digital asset that achieved a high price above $400 per coin in December that same calendar year. However, Litecoin then suffered a large fall in value over the coming year in line with the broader cryptocurrency market.Litecoin compared to Bitcoin was held up as a faster cryptocurrency regarding the ability to ‘mine’ its blockchain, and its transactional ability was also hailed as faster than Bitcoin, and these elements remain true to this day for the decentralized digital asset. However, not everything has been wine and roses for Litecoin early adapters, speculators and investors. Litecoin, like all cryptocurrencies, has enjoyed days of highs and extreme lows as technical and market behaviors have frequently caused storms.At the time of writing in August 2021, LTC/USD has gone through the whirlwind of its spring 2021 surge and slump like most of the major cryptocurrencies. The month of August certainly produced a rather nice climb for Litecoin, but prior to this bullish trend, LTC/USD suffered steep losses and saw lows just above $100'',

    ''Australian billionaire Andrew Budzinski, 49, founded the renowned Australian CFD and Forex broker IC Markets. He was 2024’s 65th wealthiest Australian, with a net worth of A$2.71 billion, and faces two separate lawsuits that could cost him hundreds of millions of dollars if he is found liable.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe secretive, little-known billionaire and IC Markets face a class action lawsuit for pocketing A$1+ billion in profits and dividends on the back of heavy losses by the broker’s retail traders. An additional lawsuit charges Budzinski with violating Fair Work policies by berating staff using homophobic slurs, threatening to withhold salaries, and sacking the entire Australian office. The question is, do the lawsuits hold merit, and what might the outcomes mean for the Australian and global retail trading industries?The second lawsuit, about Fair Work violations, targets the character of Budzinski in allegations made by a former disgruntled employee targeting Finohelp Support Pty Ltd., a support services company that assisted IC Markets with payroll. So, I will not dive into what may or may not have occurred, as it has no direct impact on CFD and Forex traders in Australia. The class action lawsuits should concern Australian-resident traders, however, as they could open the gates for more counter-productive regulatory changes, pushing Australia further behind competitive alternatives.What Should You Know Before We Look at The Allegations?Between 70% and 90% of retail traders lose money, which has less to do with leverage maximums and more to do with a lack of market education, discipline, and knowledge. Regulators cannot force traders to acquire the necessary knowledge to trade more profitably, or to use proper risk management, or comprehend the relationship between risk management, position sizing, and leverage. So, they lower the maximum leverage as a blunt regulatory tool. This gives the illusion'',

    ''Currency pairings are used to estimate currency unit prices in the forex market. The base currency (also known as transaction currency) is the initial currency mentioned in a currency pair quote, succeeded by the quote currency (also known as the counter currency). A financial firm can use the base currency as the accounting currency or domestic currency to reflect all profits or losses for financial reporting reasons.Base Currency Definition in ForexIn the Forex market, the base currency is the first of two currencies seen in a currency pair quote. After the base currency, the quotation mentions the counter currency. Let’s find out more about base currency and what it means in Forex.AdvertisementTake advantage of today''''s market opportunitiesSTART TRADING NOWUnderstanding base currencyThe base currency in a currency pair, such as USD/GBP, is the first currency specified (where the USD is the base currency). The quotation, also known as the counter currency, is the second currency. We generally expect the base currency to increase in respect of the quote/counter currency whether you "long" the currency pair. You would predict the reverse if you were "short" on the pair.What Are Examples of Base Currency?The euro versus the US dollar, generally known as EUR/USD, is the most frequently traded currency pair. Here''''s an illustration of how to understand currency pairs:It''''s 2024, and John is planning a trip to California. He lives in England and only carries pounds sterling. As a result, he goes to a forex agency to convert his GBP to USD. The rate is USD/GBP = 1.4, according to the Forex executive. This implies that $1 is worth 1.4 GBP.In my case, the quote currency is GBP, and the base currency is USD. As a result, John can swap 1.4 GBP for USD 1 at the Forex market.There are numerous distinct currency pairs around the world, and they are classified according to the frequency and magnitude of their dealings.

    ''Forex trading is the latest market that blockchain technology is disrupting in 2025.The Forex market, which is operational 24/7, and blockchain, which provides the technological basis for cryptocurrency trading, are ideal for integration. Blockchain offers transparent, secure, fast, and cost-effective transaction methods. For this reason, the technology holds incredible promise for the Forex industry, although certain challenges need to be overcome. In this article, we''''ll dig deep into how blockchain has the potential to transform Forex trading, the pros and cons for the industry, and how this technology can be leveraged.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow Blockchain WorksA blockchain is a ledger (a digital record of transactions) that executes secure transactions in a peer-to-peer network. It processes, stores, verifies, and records data automatically on the network, usually with a decentralized system. So, for two people to transact, there''''s no need for an intermediary such as a bank or payment processor.When a blockchain is decentralized, this means that no single entity has complete control. It can be governed communally, by hundreds, if not thousands, of network nodes. As a result, it is incredibly secure, as there''''s no single point of failure. That means that data cannot be modified or deleted without a network consensus.The primary use case for blockchain technology is that it allows people to transact cryptocurrencies, although blockchains can now integrate other types of data and use smart contracts. This enables the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can take real-world assets such as property and data onto the blockchain. So, when it comes to Forex trading, traditional fiat currency can be merged with blockchain technology to increase trade efficiency.Public vs Private BlockchainsThere are two distinct types of blockchains:Public blockchains are decentralized and open, so anyone can participate a'',

    ''Intro to Trading StocksTop Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHere are ten essential takeaways for trading stocks:Buying a stock means buying a piece of a company. That’s why stocks are also called shares: owning a stock is owning a “share” of a company. If I buy one Apple share, it literally means I own a (tiny) piece of the company Apple.Companies issue stocks to raise capital to finance their business. When a company issues stocks for the first time, it is called an “Initial Public Offering” (IPO).A stock exchange is a centralized body that “lists” companies’ shares for brokers to buy and sell on behalf of their clients. The largest stock exchange in the world is the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE), with over two thousand different companies’ stocks. Stock exchanges are highly regulated to protect investors and companies participating in them.Some companies pay dividends, which are direct payments from their profits to the stock''''s owners. I remember my dad getting physical dividend checks from companies whose stocks he owned!Some trading instruments allow trading the price of a stock without physically buying and selling it. For example, CFDs and futures contracts can mirror the stock price but do not involve holding the stock itself. The advantage is trading on leverage and taking short positions, both of which are not always possible when trading the stock directly. The best stock brokers offer a wide selection of individual stocks for trading at competitive fees, overseen by sufficient regulation.Options contracts (i.e., “call” and “put” options) are also a popular method of trading stocks. They allow traders to access leverage, take short positions, and find unique ways to profit from stock price movements. For example, some option strategies allow traders to profit if a stock price stays in a specified range.The primary measure of a stock’s fundamental value is its price-earnings ratio or “PE.” This is the stock’s pr'',

    ''I never thought I’d write an article asking whether Bitcoin could replace gold. That fact is a sign of newer times. Bitcoin and gold could not be more different - gold reaches back to the history books, while Bitcoin is futuristic. However, with BTC’s current value and acceptance, comparing gold and Bitcoin has become a legitimate line of inquiry.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewSo, let’s evaluate Bitcoin and gold, examining their regulations, security, utility, and comparative value.Bitcoin’s Emergence into the Gold “Space”In December 2024, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said in a live interview, “People use Bitcoin as a speculative asset. It’s like gold, only it’s virtual. It’s digital… It’s not a competitor for the dollar. It’s really a competitor for gold.” Before using this as evidence to conclude the case in favor of Bitcoin replacing gold, I want to give the quote context: the interviewer’s question was primarily about Bitcoin versus the U.S. Dollar. Powell’s response was more about Bitcoin not competing with the U.S. Dollar. And this was a conversation, not an official statement recording the position of the Federal Reserve.However, Powell’s response was significant for two reasons:1) He is the Fed Chair2) He chose to compare it to gold without the interviewer asking about gold.Today, Bitcoin is tagged as the “Digital Gold.” What does this mean? When analysts talk about Bitcoin’s emergence into the gold “space,” they are referring to gold’s status as a strategic reserve.
