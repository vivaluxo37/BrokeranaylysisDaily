Yes, the Middle East conflict which escalated on the 13th of June caused some temporary risk adverse trading, but by early last week’s ceasefire Forex resumed its negative USD outlook. There is also the factor of an outlook which believes the Federal Reserve will have to begin cutting interest rates in the mid-term which has been priced into the USD in recent weeks.Bullish Sentiment and Federal Reserve Outlook Storm CloudsHighs attained in the EUR/USD which are testing long-term values will now run into questions. The consideration that the currency pair may have become too overbought and will now face a test of choppiness due to certain factors already having been priced in are legitimate. If financial institutions have factored two interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, this could now begin to create headwinds for the EUR/USD as financial institutions consider fair market outlook.Short and near-term considerations regarding the U.S spending bill may also factor into Forex over the first week of July. While it seems likely a budget bill will eventually be passed, it might not come about easily and this could cause storms in Forex until clarity is achieved.

His comments bolstered demand for precious metals as an inflation hedge, as he expressed support for US interest rate cuts at the FOMC meeting on July 29th and 30th. Precious metals markets also received support as a safe haven from global trade tensions, following President Trump''''s announcement last Wednesday of his intention to send tariff letters to over 150 countries, notifying them that tariff rates could be 10% or 15% starting August 1st.On the economic front, strong US economic news on Friday showed optimism regarding Federal Reserve policy, while limiting gains in precious metal prices.

The Trump administration announced a trade agreement with Japan, subjecting Tokyo''''s exports to the US, including automobiles, to a 15% tariff. Japan also pledged to invest $550 million US dollars in the United States, becoming the first country to reach an agreement before Donald Trump''''s August 1st deadline for trade deals.The US-Japan agreement reportedly includes only a 15% tariff on imports from Japan, primarily in exchange for a promise from the Japanese government to invest $550 billion in the United States.

According to gold trading platforms, the yellow metal''''s prices declined amid positive investor sentiment following the announcement of the trade agreement between the United States and the European Union.This agreement imposes a 15% tariff on most European goods—including automobiles and computer chips—while the EU commits to purchasing $750 billion in US energy and additional military equipment. Meanwhile, US and Chinese negotiators are scheduled to meet later today in an effort to extend the current trade truce and prevent new tariffs.Also, investors are focused on the Federal Reserve’s policy announcement scheduled for Wednesday, looking for clues on future US interest rate moves.

There is what I considered to be an “inner consolidation area” between the $3300 level and the $3400 level. So, in other words, I think there are plenty of places to see a lot of noise and choppiness, and unless we put some external pressure on this market, we may very well just jump back and forth in the same range for the month. I am bullish in general, but I also recognize that we need some type of momentum to get things moving.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewAll things being equal, I do believe that eventually we could break out to the upside, but I don’t know if it will be during the month of August. If it is, then it probably means that the US dollar is falling, or perhaps there is a major “risk off” move in the markets, and gold will be used to protect wealth. I do recognize that we have been in a long-term uptrend for some time, at least until the last couple of months. This consolidation area lines up perfectly with the old adage of “sell in May and go away” that Wall Street quite often will quote. Perhaps that’s all there is, but if we were to break down below the $3000 level, then I think you’ve got a situation where gold really starts to crumble.
