The gold price index closed the week stable around $3349 per ounce, amidst a bullish market momentum that could persist until August 1st, the date set by Trump for imposing more tariffs against global economies. The return of US dollar weakness and lower Treasury bond yields allowed the gold market to recover again.The decline in the US dollar and yields coincided with cautious statements from Federal Reserve Governor Waller last Thursday evening. His comments bolstered demand for precious metals as an inflation hedge, as he expressed support for US interest rate cuts at the FOMC meeting on July 29th and 30th. Precious metals markets also received support as a safe haven from global trade tensions, following President Trump''s announcement last Wednesday of his intention to send tariff letters to over 150 countries, notifying them that tariff rates could be 10% or 15% starting August 1st.On the economic front, strong US economic news on Friday showed optimism regarding Federal Reserve policy, while limiting gains in precious metal prices. June''s US housing starts and building permits reports came in better than expected. The University of Michigan''s US consumer confidence index for July also rose more than anticipated, reaching a five-month high.Trading Tips:We advise to monitor market influencing factors and an',

According to gold trading platforms, this profit-taking pushed the gold price index down to the $3382 per ounce support level before gold prices stabilized around $3391 per ounce at the start of today''s trading session, Thursday, July 24, 2025. Markets are currently awaiting the European Central Bank''s monetary policy announcement.Contributing to gold''s selling pressure is the rise in the US dollar, which occurred after the United States reached its first tariff agreement with a major trading partner. The Trump administration announced a trade agreement with Japan, subjecting Tokyo''s exports to the US, including automobiles, to a 15% tariff. Japan also pledged to invest $550 million US dollars in the United States, becoming the first country to reach an agreement before Donald Trump''s August 1st deadline for trade deals.The US-Japan agreement reportedly includes only a 15% tariff on imports from Japan, primarily in exchange for a promise from the Japanese government to invest $550 billion in the United States. Japan appears set to establish a sovereign wealth fund for this purpose, with Trump having input on how it''s invested.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewNevertheless, caution persists as talks with other key partners remain deadlocked.

Gold prices fell from the $3345 per ounce resistance to the $3312 per ounce support level before bouncing back to $3336 per ounce at the time of writing. According to gold trading platforms, the yellow metal''s prices declined amid positive investor sentiment following the announcement of the trade agreement between the United States and the European Union.This agreement imposes a 15% tariff on most European goods—including automobiles and computer chips—while the EU commits to purchasing $750 billion in US energy and additional military equipment. Meanwhile, US and Chinese negotiators are scheduled to meet later today in an effort to extend the current trade truce and prevent new tariffs.Also, investors are focused on the Federal Reserve’s policy announcement scheduled for Wednesday, looking for clues on future US interest rate moves. Adding to the market’s cautious tone is a busy economic calendar featuring key US labor data such as nonfarm payrolls, ADP employment, and JOLTS job openings. The PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) price index will also be closely watched for signs that tariffs might be driving inflationary pressures.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewGold Trading Scenarios:Bearish Scenario: According to the daily timeframe chart, and potentially with a no-depo',

    'Gold markets continue to be very noisy during the month of July, and I think August will be more of the same due to a serious lack of volume during the month of August in typical trading years.After all, this is a market that continues to see a lot of volatility and choppiness in a well-defined $300 range, and at this point I’m not sure what it will take to break out of that area.Consolidation RangeTop Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe $3200 level below is a massive support level, just as the $3500 level above is a massive resistance barrier. There is what I considered to be an “inner consolidation area” between the $3300 level and the $3400 level. So, in other words, I think there are plenty of places to see a lot of noise and choppiness, and unless we put some external pressure on this market, we may very well just jump back and forth in the same range for the month. I am bullish in general, but I also recognize that we need some type of momentum to get things moving.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewAll things being equal, I do believe that eventually we could break out to the upside, but I don’t know if it will be during the month of August. If it is, then it probably means that the US dollar is falling, or perhaps there is a major “risk off” move in the markets, and gold will be used to protect wealth. I do recognize that we have been in a long-term uptrend for some time, at least until the last couple of months. This consolidation area lines up perfectly with the old adage of “sell in May and go away” that Wall Street quite often will quote. Perhaps that’s all there is, but if we were to break down below the $3000 level, then I think you’ve got a situation where gold really starts to crumble. I give that about a 15% chance, so I am still looking at short-term pullbacks as buying opportunities.Ready to trade our monthly forecast?

    'The NASDAQ 100 has continued to grind higher during the month of July, and it now looks as if we are trying to do everything, we can to continue that heading into the changeover into the month of August.Short-term pullbacks are very likely to be at this point, mainly due to the fact that we are just running out of volume and, interest.Most traders that are trading with significant size tend to holiday in the month of August, and that means that your expectations for big moves in August typically will be better served to be squashed.UptrendTop Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewRegardless of anything that happens in the month of August, we will certainly still be in an uptrend, so I look at the market as one that I am buying dips and making profit as it comes. Longer-term, I fully anticipate that we are going to go toward the 24,000 level, maybe even the 25,000 level. The price action this year has been nothing short of insane, as we had a massive meltdown, only to see an even more ferocious rally. In an environment like this, it’s obvious that no matter what happens, there are people out there willing to buy this market, as it seems like every other day, we get a headline about tariffs or trade problems that could end up being negative for the markets, but they are forgotten about the next day. In other words, the buyers are very aggressive, and it looks like any correction would be welcomed as a buying opportunity.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewUltimately, this is a market that I would like to see pullback toward the 22,250 level and bounce, but I don’t even know forget that deep of a correction. Keep in mind that the 23,000 level is also important, at least from a support standpoint. Again, to the upside think we are looking to the 24,000 level, but it might need a little bit of a pullback in order to offer enough value to get big money to come in and push things higher.Ready to trade our monthly forecast?
