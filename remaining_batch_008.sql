Breaking below that level opens up the possibility of a move down to the 18.5 MXN level, possibly even lower than that. However, we have recently seen a certain amount of negativity coming out of the US economy, which while you would think that would be very negative for the US dollar, the reality is that it has horrific effect on the Mexican economy as the Mexicans send roughly 85% of their exports into America.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewIn other words, the Mexicans have to worry about their biggest customer, and if they do in fact see the Americans slowing down into a recession, they will be buying as many Mexican goods.If we get to that situation, then a break above the 19.50 MXN level could be possible, and it could even open up a move to the 20 MXN level. However, I suspect that this would be more of a “shock to the system” type of more than anything else. If things stay somewhat stable over the next several weeks, then it’s likely that we will see the US dollar continue to suffer a little bit of negativity against the Mexican peso as the interest rate differential most certainly favors the Mexican peso over the US dollar. The last couple of months have been negative, and unless something shocks the system, it’s very likely that we could see a little bit of continuation in this trend.Ready to trade our monthly forec', 'The Mexican peso may keep pressuring the US dollar in July 2025 unless a US economic shock reverses the trend; key support sits near 18.80 MXN.', 'usdmxn-monthly-forecast-july-2025-chart', 'General', 'Broker Analysis', 'NULL', 'published', '2025-08-21T13:03:48.990336', '2025-08-21T13:03:48.990349', 'C:\\Users\\LENOVO\\Desktop\\BrokeranalysisDaily\\daily forex\\www.dailyforex.com\\forex-technical-analysis\\2025\\06\\usdmxn-forecast-july-2025\\230391.html'),

The following press conference saw the Euro and Pound soar for an hour or two before falling back and giving up much of their earlier gains, so there seems to have been nothing from the ECB that caused a sustained change.

However, all that changed in the early hours of Friday in the Middle East as news broke of a very strong Israeli strike on Iran’s key military figures and its nuclear materials and scientists. This sent markets into a risk-off direction.The Israeli strike has led to what could be described as all-out war between Israel and Iran, with Iran firing powerful ballistic missiles at Israeli population centers, and Israel in turn hitting hard at the military, the nuclear program, and increasingly at Iranian oil facilities.This war has been long awaited, and it seems clear that the Israeli attack was acquiesced in by the Americans, who so far at least are not helping with offensive actions, although they are likely assisting in Israel’s strong antimissile defense, which is continuing to intercept over 90% of projectiles. However, the missiles which get through cause serious damage and fatalities, although at a level the Israeli public can probably accept, at least for a few more days or weeks.It seems clear that the Iranian regime and nuclear program is in serious jeopardy, the nuclear program more so, and Iran has a limited supply of perhaps 2,000 ballistic missiles that it may not be able to replenish. The big question is whether the Americans will join in the drive to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, or whether Iran might sue for a negotiated settlement that would be acceptable to the USA.Th', 'Geopolitical tensions boost Gold and Oil.

It looks very much like a victory for Israel and the USA.The USA claims that the strikes have been completely successful. The International Atomic Energy Agency has stated that it can find no increase in radiation levels from these facilities following the strikes.Al Jazeera is reporting that Iranian technicians spent the past three days removing materials from the key Fordow plant. Whether this is a significant development or not remains to be seen, but there is plenty of jubilation, or at least quiet relief, throughout the Middle East, Europea, and the USA today.The Iranian government is now also claiming that enriched uranium was removed from Fordow before the attack. One might consider that given the capabilities already demonstrated by Israel and the USA, that these countries are likely to have a good idea where it is now.Although the Iranian regime has issued blood-curling threats, pledging that no US citizen will be safe anywhere (a clear war crime if ever there was one, to add to its targeting of Israeli civilian buildings with cluster munitions last week), its response so far has been limited to a relatively small (45) missile barrage on Israel, which does not seem to have caused any fatalities.

Both Israel and the Trump administration have been quite belligerent, threatening to resume bombing if Iran acts to rebuild its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. The scale of the victory will certainly tilt the dynamics of the Middle East towards Israel and the USA, with the Trump administration hinting that further countries, possibly even including Syria, will shortly be joining the Abraham accords, i.e. making a formal peace with Israel.The aftermath of the war has seen risk assets, especially in the USA, increase in value, with major US stock market indices like the NASDAQ 100 and the S&P 500 breaking out to new all-time high prices, which is usually a very bullish sign.This bullish environment is interesting as it contradicts some economic data we got this week and what the Federal Reserve is saying, not to mention the 9th July Trump tariff deadline which is just around the corner.Jerome Powell, Chair of the Fed, has now led investors to expect three further rate cuts this year of 0.25% each, up from two.Final GDP data for the USA came in notably worse than expected, suggesting a recession might even be possible.Turning to the 9th July tariff deadline, the USA has concluded only two trade deals, meaning that if more deals are not inked over the next 10 days, the US will impose much higher tariffs on many countries.
