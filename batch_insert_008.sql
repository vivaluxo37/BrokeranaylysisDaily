    ''Fundamental Analysis & Market SentimentI wrote on 20th April that the best trades for the week would be:Long of the EUR/USD currency pair. Unfortunately, it fell by 0.24% over the week.Short of the USD/JPY currency pair. Unfortunately, it rose by 1.00% over the week.Long of Gold following a daily (New York) close above $3,343.10. This set up on Monday but unfortunately the price then fell by 3.06% over the rest of the week.The overall result was a loss of 4.30%, which was 1.43% per asset.Last week saw a much calmer market as we seem to have moved beyond any new tariff bombshells. Negotiations will be ongoing until the 90-day period ends in early July.The major event of last week, which had a very light news agenda, was President Trump’s attempt at a gentle walk back of his comments blasting Jerome Powell of the Federal Reserve for not cutting rates more aggressively, which had led to a sharp fall in stock markets the previous week. Trump’s comments may have aided the recovery we saw in stock markets and in other risky assets last week.Last week’s other major data points were:Flash Services & Manufacturing PMI UA, Germany, UK, France – mostly worse than expected, suggested slowing economies.Chair of Swiss National Bank SpeechCanada Retail Sales – as expected.US Unemployment Claims – as expected.UK Retail Sales – this was much better than expected, showing a 0.4% month-on-month increase, when a decline of 0.3% was anticipated.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe Week Ahead: 28th April – 2nd MayThe coming week has a busy schedule of important releases, including key US economic data and a policy meeting at the Bank of Japan.This week’s important data points, in order of likely importance, are:US Core PCE Price IndexUS Average Hourly EarningsUS Non-Farm Employment ChangeGerman Preliminary CPIAustralian CPI (inflation)US Advance GDPBank of Japan Policy Rate, Monetary Policy Statement, and Outlook ReportCanadian GDPCanadian'',

    ''USD/CADThe US dollar has plummeted against the Canadian dollar during trading this past week, as we are now testing the crucial 1.3750 level. The 1.3750 level is an area that is very important, and at this point in time, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of volatility and potential support, but at this point, I would need to see the US dollar recapture the 1.39 level to begin to think about buying against the Canadian dollar, despite the fact that there is still no trade agreement between the 2 economies.Crude OilThe crude oil markets have been all over the place during the week, as we tested the $65 level but then turned around to show signs of hesitation. The $60 level seems to be offering support, and if we can stay above that level, then I think you’ve got a real opportunity to go back and forth on short-term chart. I think that’s probably the most likely turn of events, but Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs being recommended against the European Union starting June 1, and that could be negative for oil, only time will tell. If we can recapture the $65 level on a daily close, then I think crude oil can rally quite nicely.USD/JPYThe US dollar fell rather significantly during the trading week against the Japanese yen, and now that we have more chaos involving tariffs, it’s possible that we could see the Japanese yen continue to strengthen. This flies in the face of the interest rate situation, and at this point in time I am fairly neutral about this pair. I believe there is a ton of support between current levels in the ¥140 level, so I am looking for stability and a turnaround to start buying. If we were to break down below the ¥140 level, that would be extraordinarily negative.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThis might be one of the more interesting pears this week, as the United States and the European Union are about to ratchet up tensions as far as tariffs are concerned.

    ''GoldGold markets obviously have been at the forefront of everybody’s thought process lately, and this last week would have been no different. With that being said, it’s probably worth noting that we are seeing hesitation above the $3.400 level for the 3rd week in a row. This doesn’t necessarily mean that gold is going to fall apart, but I do think we have some work to do to get moving. That being said, you should also keep in mind that the US and Chinese delegates meet this weekend.GBP/USDThis is one of the most interesting charts for me on the weekly timeframe in the world of forex. Quite frankly, we are struggling mightily to break above the 1.34 level, and the fact that we are finishing the week with a candlestick that looks a lot like a shooting star, and preceded by 2 actual shooting stars, tells me that we are on the precipice of a potential strengthening of the US dollar. By contrast, if we can break above the 1.35 level, the British pound could soar at that point, perhaps picking up another 500 pips. Nonetheless, it’s worth noting that there are several charts starting to hint that the US dollar is potentially going to make a comeback.USD/CADThis is one of those charges I was speaking about. The engulfing candlestick on the weekly chart suggest that buyers have stepped in and started buying the greenback against the Canadian dollar in mass. This makes sense, as Canada still does not have a trade deal with its most important trading partner, the United States. By extension, this means that the Canadian economy is going to remain under pressure, and therefore I think we will see the greenback continue higher.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThis is an interesting chart as well, as we have seen market participants go in both directions all week, as we tested the 1.12 level at the very lows, but have since bounced quite nicely.

    ''DAXThe German index initially tried to take off to the upside on Monday, as we gapped higher, only to turn around and fill the gap. That being said, the €23,500 level looks to be a significant support level as we have bounced nicely from there, and ultimately, I think we have a situation where the market has recently broken above significant resistance, and it’s likely that we will continue to see buyers on each and every dip. I suspect at this point the DAX will go looking to the €25,000 level.USD/JPYThe US dollar initially fell during the week against the Japanese yen, but the ¥145 level has offered support. All things being equal, this is a market that continues to see a lot of volatility, but there are a lot of buyers underneath that will continue to come into the market and choose the US dollar due to the interest rate differential, as the Bank of Japan has absolutely no real chance of tightening anytime soon. Meanwhile, bonds are selling off in the United States, driving yields higher.GoldGold has had a tough week, but it looks as if we are closing just below the crucial $3200 level. The $3200 level of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area that a lot of people would be watching very closely. After all, it has served as support and resistance multiple times, and of course we are in the middle of a massive rally overall. With this being the case, I do suspect that if we can recapture the $3200 level, then it is possible that the gold market starts reaching toward the upside yet again.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewBitcoinBitcoin has a pretty choppy week but ultimately ended up settling on a fairly unchanged turn of events. All things being equal, this is a market that continues to find buyers on dips, and therefore I suspect it is probably only a matter of time before we break out above the crucial $106,000 level, allowing us to take a serious look at breaking above the $110,00'',

    ''WTI/CL CrudeThe West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil market fell pretty significantly during the trading week, as we are looking to close below the $60 level. This is an area that I think attracts a lot of attention, mainly due to the fact that we had bounced so significantly from there previously. That being said, the market is closing below the $60 level, so we do need to be somewhat cautious at this point in time. All things being equal, this is a market that I think will continue to see a lot of volatility as traders are worried about demand. Ultimately, this is a sideways market at the moment, leading to the downside.GoldThe gold market initially tried to rally for the week but then fell rather hard. It’s interesting to see that the gold market is falling while the stock market is rallying. We have had a major negative correlation between gold and stocks as of late, so I’m paying close attention to the $3200 level, and then again, I would be watching at the $3000 level for some type of bounce that I can start buying again.AUD/USDThe Australian dollar has a positive week, as we are now breaking above the 50 Week EMA. By doing so, the market looks as if it is ready to continue going higher, perhaps looking to the 200 Week EMA near the 0.67 level. Ultimately, this is a market that is probably getting some benefit from the idea of China quietly looking for a trade deal with the United States, which would have a major influence on the Australian economy as they are a major supplier of raw materials for China and of course the overall economic engine that drives the rest of the world as far as manufacturing is concerned.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThe euro has been all over the place during the course of the week, as we continue to look for some type of directionality.

The talks, involving key officials like US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, aim to reduce tariffs, previously 145% on Chinese goods and 125% on US exports—that have disrupted supply chains and raised recession fears.A potential deal could stabilize equities, increase risk appetite, and drive capital into assets like Bitcoin, seen as a hedge against economic uncertainty.Reduced tariffs could also weaken the US dollar, enhancing Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value.
