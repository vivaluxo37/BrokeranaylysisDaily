Quite frankly, we still have a lot of noise out there when it comes to tariff wars, and when you look at the longer-term charts, it’s obvious that we have seen so much in the way of upward momentum that it only can go sideways for a while, working off some of the excess froth. Currently, we are trading in the middle of the overall consolidation range between $3200 on the bottom, and the $3500 level at the top.SilverSilver has broken above a major resistance barrier in the form of $37.50, an area that has been difficult to get above the month. Ultimately, short-term pullbacks will end up being buying opportunities in this market, and if we can pull back toward the $37.50 level, then I think you have a real shot at the market finding a bit of “market memory” in this area. Based on the “measured move” of the previous consolidation, it’s likely that silver will try to get to the $40 level above.DAXThe German index DAX rally during most of the week and even managed to pierce above the €24,500 level. The market breaking above that level was a bullish sign, but we have given back some of these gains, so I think we are still very much in the way of consolidation. Looking at this chart, the €23,500 level should be thought of as a short-term floor, and I think it makes a lot of sense that we go sideways for a little bit before continuing the overall uptrend as Germany tends to lead the way for the European Union.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThe euro fell during the course of the week, as we are a little bit overdone at this point, and a pullback from here probably opens up the possibility of a move down to the 1.16 level. The 1.16 level is an area that previously had been resistant, and therefore it makes a certain amount of sense that the market sees that as a potential floor. If we break down below there,'',
