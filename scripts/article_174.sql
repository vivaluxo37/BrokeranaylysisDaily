    'SilverSilver markets spent most of the week selling off, as we have seen a lot of volatility around the world. At this point, it’s worth noting that the US dollar sold off a bit but held firm against certain currencies. In other words, it looks like the volatility is only somewhat justified, and I think at this point in time it’s worth noting that the $36 level seems to be a significant support level just waiting to happen. If we can recapture the $37.50 level, we will probably reenter the range that we had been in during the previous month.GBP/USDThe British pound has plunged for most of the week, testing the crucial 1.32 region. However, we have found a little bit of support at the end of the week as the jobs number in the United States was horrible. This has the US dollar on the back foot just a little bit, but quite frankly, it has held its own fairly well, all things being considered. If we break down below the 50 Week EMA at the 1.3063 region, I suspect that the British pound will start to fall apart. If the British pound falls apart against the US dollar, the greenback probably swallows everything else right along with it.EUR/USDThe euro dropped fairly significantly during the course of the week to peek below the 1.15 level for a while but did recover a bit after the Non-Farm Payroll number came out of the United States much weaker than anticipated. This is an ugly candlestick regardless, so I do think this is a situation where if we get any follow-through whatsoever, namely a breakdown below the bottom of the weekly candlestick from the one that we just printed, the euro could be in serious trouble at that point. On the other hand, if we recapture the 1.16 level, then it’s likely that this pair will look likely to reach the 1.18 level eventually.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewBitcoinBitcoin has had a tough week, but quite frankly Bitcoin had been a little stretched.
