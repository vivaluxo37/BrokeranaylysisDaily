The RBNZ had lowered rates at six consecutive meetings, chopping 225 basis points during that period. The benchmark rate has remained at its lowest level since August 2022.RBNZ statement: Uncertainty Requires CautionWhy the change in rate policy? The rate statement noted that the “economic outlook remains highly uncertain” and said that the rate path would depend on the following factors – the speed of the economic recovery, inflation and the impact of tariffs.At the same time, the RBNZ signaled that it would continue to loosen monetary policy if inflation continued to ease as the Bank has projected. The Bank released an updated inflation forecast which projected inflation moving towards the top of the Bank’s 1-3% target band in mid-2025 and easing to around 2% by early 2026 due to lower underlying inflation and spare capacity in the economy.The bottom line of the RBNZ rate decision? Today’s hold is likely a short breather rather than a change in monetary policy. The RBNZ signaled at the meeting that it plans to continue trimming rates in order to kick-start the struggling economy, assuming that the economy, and particularly inflation, evolves in line with the RBNZ’s forecasts.The New Zealand economy tipped into a recession last year and lower global demand has hurt the export-dependent economy. The markets expect at least one more rate cut before the end of the year but the rate path will largely depend on inflation and growth data.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewNew Zealand Dollar Steady, Stock Market Dips SharplyThe New Zealand dollar has shown a muted response to today’s rate decision.The NZD/USD currency pairis currently trading at 0.5993, down 0.07% on the day.

NZD steady, stock market drops.'), ('US and Canadian Inflation Accelerates - 15/07', 'The markets were braced for a rebound in June inflation in Canada and the US and that’s exactly what happened today in both countries, as CPI and core CPI climbed higher.US CPI, Core CPI Hotter in JuneThe US consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-on year in June, up from 2.4% in May, matching the consensus expectation. This was the second consecutive monthly rise in inflation, which is now at its highest level since February 2025. On a month-on-month basis, CPI rose to 0.3% from 0.1% in May, the largest increase in five months and matching the consensus.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, climbed to 2.9% from 2.8% but below the consensus of 3.0%. Monthly, the core rate rose 0.3%, up from 0.1% in May and matched the consensus.The hotter June inflation numbers were most likely driven by President Trump’s tariffs, which have raised the price on most products imported into the US. The tariffs, which were first imposed in April, did not show a spike in inflation until now and we can expect upcoming that the tariffs will also be felt in upcoming inflation reports as the tariffs continue to filter through the US economy.Today’s hot inflation report means pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower rates will ease. The money markets have priced a hold at the July 30 meeting at close to 100%, although the Fed is expected to resume cutting rates in the fourth quarter.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewCanada’s CPI Hits 1.9%Canada’s inflation rate also heated up in June. CPI rose to 1.9% year-on-year, up from 1.7% in May and in line with the consensus. Inflation remained below the Bank of Canada’s target rate of 2% for a third successive month. Monthly, CPI dropped to 0.1%, compared to 0.6% in May and matching the consensus expectation. The trimmed-mean core CPI, which the BoC uses as its preferred gauge for underlying inflation, was unchanged at 3% y/y, as expected. BoC policymakers won’t be losing any sleep over headline CPI, which remains below the 2% target, but would like to see core CPI ease before delivering a rate cut.US Dollar Shows Muted Reaction, US Stock Market Edges Higher After Inflation ReportThe US dollar is showing limited in the aftermath of today’s inflation report. TheEUR/USD currency pairandGBP/USDare showing almost no change today.USD/JPYis up 0.34%, trading at 148.14.USD/CADhas weakened slightly following the US and Canadian inflation reports and is down 0.08% on the day, trading at 1.3693.The US stock market has only been open for a short time and is showing slight gains.TheS&P 500 Indexis up 13.8 points (0.22%) and is currently trading at 6,280.TheNasdaq 100 Indexhas gained 133.3 points (0.65%) and is currently trading at 20,773.', 'US, Canada CPI rise in June; US hits 2.7%, core 2.9%.

CPI remained at its lowest annual inflation rate since February 2021. Monthly CPI eased, rising to 0.2% from 0.3%, in line with market expectations. Gasoline and fuel oil prices continued to decline sharply, a key factor in easing inflation.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, moved in the opposite direction. Annual CPI climbed to 3.1% in July, up from 2.9% and above the market estimate of 3.0%. This marked the highest level in five months. Monthly, the core rate rose 0.3%, up from 0.2% and in line with the market estimate.The rise in core CPI reflects the effect of Trump''s tariffs, which took effect in April and continue to filter through the economy. The tariffs are expected to dampen growth and raise inflation, as US consumers pay more for imported goods.Inflation Report Likely Cements Rate Cut in SeptemberThe Federal Reserve has been on an extended pause and hasn''t lowered interest rates since December 2024. That is expected to change at the next Fed meeting, barring an extreme surprise. The markets have currently priced in a 94% likelihood of a rate cut at the Sep. 17 meeting, up sharply from 84% just before the inflation release. Investors were clearly relieved that CPI remained at 2.7% and didn''t rise to 2.8% as expected, anticipating that this will clear the path for the Fed to lower rates next month.US Dollar Shows Muted Response, Stock Market Edges Higher after Inflation ReportThe US dollar is showing little reaction following the release of the US inflation report, while the US stock market is in positive territory.TheGBP/USD currency pairis trading at 1.3482, up 0.35% on the day, but most of these gains were recorded ahead of the inflation release.The US stock market has posted gains on Tuesday, as investors reacted positively to the inflation report.TheS&P 500 Indexhas climbed 26 points (0.41%) and is trading at 6399.TheNasdaq 100 Indexhas climbed 86 points (0.36%) and is trading at 23,613.', 'US inflation remained at 2.7% in July as core CPI rose to 3.1%, reinforcing expectations of a September Fed rate cut and lifting US stocks.', 'us-inflation-unchanged-but-core-cpi-accelerates', 'General', 'Broker Analysis', NULL, 'published', '2025-08-20T11:27:14.168352', '2025-08-20T11:27:14.168360', 'C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\BrokeranalysisDaily\daily forex\www.brokeranalysis.com\forex-news\2025\08\us-inflation-unchanged-but-core-cpi-accelerates\232615.html', 'US inflation remained at 2.7% in July as core CPI rose to 3.1%, reinforcing expectations of a September Fed rate cut and lifting US stocks.'), ('Adam Lemon - Broker Analysis Authors.com', 'Published articles: 11926About Adam LemonAdam Lemon began his role at Broker Analysis in 2013 when he was brought in as an in-house Chief Analyst.
