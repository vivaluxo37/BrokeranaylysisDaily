('Trade W Officially Launches New Logo',
    'A new era in global trading begins with Trade W. The same trusted platform but with a fresh look, a powerful new slogan and with a renewed promise to our users. Dubai, June 2025 — Trade W operated by Tradewill Global LLC, a leading global forex trading platform, is pleased to announce the official unification of its brand identity under the name Trade W, along with the launch of a refreshed new logo. Tradewill Global LLC has been serving traders worldwide through its web-based trading platform under the name “Tradewill,” while its mobile app community is more widely recognized as “Trade W.” To address this disparity and strengthen brand consistency, it has decided to consolidate all operations and communications under the single, unified brand — Trade W. Yuan Zhang, Head of Branding and Marketing at Tradewill Global LLC. says “We found that while some users recognize us as Tradewill on the web, our app community overwhelmingly knows us as Trade W. By unifying our brand as Trade W and introducing a fresh, modern logo, we aim to simplify user experience, improve brand recall, and reinforce our identity as a modern, user-focused trading platform.” As part of this rebranding initiative, Trade W will now serve as the unified brand name across all platforms — including the official website, mobile app, and all communication channels. This alignment ensures brand consistency and strengthens recognition at every user touchpoint. Furthermore, a sleek, redesigned logo has been introduced, symbolizing Trade W’s ongoing commitment to innovation, clarity, and growth. The new visual identity is modern, distinctive, and easier to recognize — enhancing user experience and brand recall compared to the previous design.

Stack Up.” This message captures the essence of the brand’s philosophy - the belief that success is a process',
