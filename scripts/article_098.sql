    'USD/JPYThe US dollar initially fell against the Japanese yen but has found enough support near the 140 level to turn things around and bounce quite significantly. It’s interesting, because the 140 level has been a major support level going back some time now, and it’s also worth noting that the 200 Week EMA sits there as well. By forming this massive hammer, and the fact that some of the rhetoric out there has gone off the rails, it’s starting to look more and more like the US dollar is in the process of bottoming. Furthermore, the Japanese yen looks like it is giving up some of that strength.USD/CHFThe US dollar initially fell during the course of the week to break down below the 0.81 level, only to turn around and bounce all the way toward the 0.83 level. The US dollar looks like it is ready to rally from here, but whether or not it can change the overall trend is a completely different question. If we can break above the 0.84 level, then I think we have a situation where we could rise as high as 0.8750 level. However, if we turn around a breakdown below the weekly candlestick, then we could drop to the 0.80 level eventually.GBP/USDThe British pound has rallied significantly during the course of the week, but it found the 1.34 level to be far too resistant to continue. By doing so, we ended up forming a bit of a shooting star. This is a market that is overbought, so a pullback makes quite a bit of sense at this point in time. In fact, I am seeing this across the board when it comes to the US dollar, so I think all things are leading to the same scenario, where the greenback is suddenly going to strengthen. That being said, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the British pound will fall apart, just that we have certainly gotten too far ahead of ourselves. However, if we were to break above the 1.34 level on a weekly close, we could really start to accelerate to the upside.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThere are',
