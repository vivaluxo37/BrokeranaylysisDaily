    'DAXThe German index initially tried to take off to the upside on Monday, as we gapped higher, only to turn around and fill the gap. That being said, the €23,500 level looks to be a significant support level as we have bounced nicely from there, and ultimately, I think we have a situation where the market has recently broken above significant resistance, and it’s likely that we will continue to see buyers on each and every dip. I suspect at this point the DAX will go looking to the €25,000 level.USD/JPYThe US dollar initially fell during the week against the Japanese yen, but the ¥145 level has offered support. All things being equal, this is a market that continues to see a lot of volatility, but there are a lot of buyers underneath that will continue to come into the market and choose the US dollar due to the interest rate differential, as the Bank of Japan has absolutely no real chance of tightening anytime soon. Meanwhile, bonds are selling off in the United States, driving yields higher.GoldGold has had a tough week, but it looks as if we are closing just below the crucial $3200 level. The $3200 level of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area that a lot of people would be watching very closely. After all, it has served as support and resistance multiple times, and of course we are in the middle of a massive rally overall. With this being the case, I do suspect that if we can recapture the $3200 level, then it is possible that the gold market starts reaching toward the upside yet again.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewBitcoinBitcoin has a pretty choppy week but ultimately ended up settling on a fairly unchanged turn of events. All things being equal, this is a market that continues to find buyers on dips, and therefore I suspect it is probably only a matter of time before we break out above the crucial $106,000 level, allowing us to take a serious look at breaking above the $110,00',
