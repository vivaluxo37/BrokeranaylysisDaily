    'Fundamental Analysis & Market SentimentI wrote on 18th May that the best trades for the week would be:Long of the NASDAQ 100 Index following a daily (New York) close above 22,161. This did not set up.Long of the S&P 500 Index following a daily (New York) close above 6,142. This did not set up.Long of Bitcoin following a daily (New York) close above $106,187. This set up last Tuesday and produced a win of 0.70%.Short of the USD/ZAR currency pair following a daily (New York) close below 17.98. This set up last Tuesday and produced a win of 0.83%.The overall win of 1.53% equals a win of 0.38% per asset.Last week saw market sentiment move into a more risk-off zone, due to two major factors:President Trump’s tax bill looks like failing in Congress, which wants to water it down in a way that would severely reduce the expenditure reductions which Trump wanted. Republicans have only a narrow majority in the House of Representatives, so Trump is not in such a strong position here to force through everything he wants into the Bill. This makes analysts less optimistic about debt reduction.After weeks of only happy noises emanating from the “trade war” which has been kicked into the sidelines, the July deadline begins to approach, and last week saw Trump going back to making quite aggressive statements. This time the EU was on the receiving end, with President Trump saying they are not negotiating in good faith, and suggesting a 50% tariff on all imports could be imposed within a week.Last week’s most important data releases were:UK CPI (inflation) – this came in considerably higher than expected, at 3.5% annualized.RBA Cash Rate & Rate Statement – interest rates were cut by 0.25% as expected, the language on inflation was just a touch hawkish.Canada CPI (inflation) – some of the data was a bit higher than expected.USA, Germany, UK, France Flash Services / Manufacturing PMI – US data was good, the rest was not.UK Retail Sales – better than expected.Canada Retail Sales – better',
