    'What is the US30?US30 is a common ticker name for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The DJIA is a major stock average in the USA which is always composed of 30 publicly traded companies listed on US stock exchanges.The DJIA has been around for a long time. It was first created as an indicator to gauge the state of the American stock market in the late 19th century. However, it has been somewhat overtaken by broader, more modern stock indices such as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100 indices. In particular, the S&P 500 Index has taken the DJIA’s old role as the barometer of the American stock market.The DJIA is price weighted, unlike modern stock indices, which are weighted by market capitalisation.The DJIA’s member companies are typically old “blue chip” companies which are involved in industrial processes, and as such, is somewhat less relevant to the modern American economy, which has become increasingly service based since the 1960s.What Is One Pip Change in US30?A pip change is the measurement used for change amounts within an exchange rate of a currency pair. It’s calculated from the last decimal point. Most major currency pairs are priced to within four decimal places, so the smallest change could be 1/100 or one percent (0.0001), which is one basis point.However, currency crosses for the Japanese Yen (EUR/JPY) have a pip of 0.01. For metals like silver and gold, a pip is 0.01 on the US30.Here’s an example: the GBP/USD moves from 1.3935 to 1.3936, so there is one pip change. If you’re using a five-digit broker and the GBP/USD moves from 1.39355 to 1.39360, there’s a half a pip change (0.5 pip).Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow to Measure Pips in BTC/USD on US30When measuring pips for BTC/USD pairs on the US30, it’s similar to when you’re trading gold - XAU/USD.
