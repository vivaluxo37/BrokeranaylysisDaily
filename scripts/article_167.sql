    'EUR/USD Analysis Summary TodayOverall Trend: Preparing for an upward shift.Today''s EUR/USD Support Levels: 1.1600 – 1.1550 – 1.1470.Today''s EUR/USD Resistance Levels: 1.1700 – 1.1770 – 1.1860EUR/USD Trading Signals:Buy EUR/USD from the support level of 1.1560, with a target of 1.1900 and a stop loss of 1.1500.Sell EUR/USD from the resistance level of 1.1770, with a target of 1.1500 and a stop loss of 1.1810.EUR/USD Technical Analysis Today:The recent attempts by the EUR/USD pair to rebound upwards did not exceed the psychological resistance level of 1.1700. The pair may begin the new week stabilizing around 1.1640 and potentially trade within narrow ranges, as the economic calendar lacks significant and influential data from either the Eurozone or the United States. At the same time, the market may remain cautious, awaiting reactions to the upcoming US inflation figures later in the week, as well as the trajectory of tariffs imposed by the US administration on global economies, including the Eurozone.Will the EUR/USD price rise to a high of 1.20 this week?According to forex currency trading experts, the upward shift for the EUR/USD pair is still in its early stages. It could reach the psychological resistance of 1.2000 if it first surpasses the 1.1820 resistance. According to the daily timeframe chart, the technical indicators are at the beginning of an upward turn. The 14-day RSI (Relative Strength Index) is around a reading of 52, not far from the neutral midline, which means the upward rebound is awaiting a stronger catalyst. At the same time, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) lines are in a neutral zone so far.A bearish scenario for the Euro/dollar could become stronger if the bears push the currency pair back to the vicinity of the 1.1550 and 1.1420 support levels respectively.Trading Advice:We advises traders to be cautious, not rush, and wait for stronger selling opportunities for the EUR/USD instead of moving in neutral territory.Keep in mind',
