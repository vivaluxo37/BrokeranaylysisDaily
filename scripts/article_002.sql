('Forex Today 05/05: Trump Pushes Powell to Cut Rates',
    'President Trump has been publicly stating that the Fed should be cutting rates faster after Friday''s strong jobs data, but the pressure will almost certainly be in vain.Friday saw the release of stronger-than-expected jobs data in the USA, with non-farm payrolls coming in at 117k while only 138k new jobs were expected. Average Hourly Earnings growth was also lower than expected, at 0.2% month-on-month. After the negative Advance GDP print earlier in the week, Trump had a fairly strong case to start calling again for rate cuts, and he reiterated his call a few hours ago while stating that Fed Chair Powell is safe in his role until 2026. Trump has no real power to fire Powell anyway.Stock markets are mixed today, with Asian markets mostly higher, while US equity index futures are trading lower off-hours since markets opened this week in Asia.Bitcoinbriefly broke above the key resistance level at $95,038 but has again fallen back to trade below the big round number at $95,000. We may eventually see a decisive bullish breakout, which could lead to a test of the record price made in December not far from $110,000.The Forex market has seen the New Zealand Dollar as the strongest major currency and the Swiss as the weakest one since today''s Tokyo open, puttingthe NZD/CHF currency crossin focus.The EUR/USD currency pairremains in a long-term bullish trend and most analysts will see it that way as long as the price holds up above the key support level at $1.1241. The US Dollar has lost some ground so far today.There will be releases later today of Swiss CPI and US ISM Services PMI data.It is a public holiday today in the UK, so Forex markets are likely to be quiet until New York opens.',
