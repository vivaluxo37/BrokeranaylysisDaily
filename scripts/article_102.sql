    'USD/CADThe US dollar has plummeted against the Canadian dollar during trading this past week, as we are now testing the crucial 1.3750 level. The 1.3750 level is an area that is very important, and at this point in time, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of volatility and potential support, but at this point, I would need to see the US dollar recapture the 1.39 level to begin to think about buying against the Canadian dollar, despite the fact that there is still no trade agreement between the 2 economies.Crude OilThe crude oil markets have been all over the place during the week, as we tested the $65 level but then turned around to show signs of hesitation. The $60 level seems to be offering support, and if we can stay above that level, then I think you’ve got a real opportunity to go back and forth on short-term chart. I think that’s probably the most likely turn of events, but Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs being recommended against the European Union starting June 1, and that could be negative for oil, only time will tell. If we can recapture the $65 level on a daily close, then I think crude oil can rally quite nicely.USD/JPYThe US dollar fell rather significantly during the trading week against the Japanese yen, and now that we have more chaos involving tariffs, it’s possible that we could see the Japanese yen continue to strengthen. This flies in the face of the interest rate situation, and at this point in time I am fairly neutral about this pair. I believe there is a ton of support between current levels in the ¥140 level, so I am looking for stability and a turnaround to start buying. If we were to break down below the ¥140 level, that would be extraordinarily negative.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThis might be one of the more interesting pears this week, as the United States and the European Union are about to ratchet up tensions as far as tariffs are concerned.
