    'SilverSilver has been back and forth during the course of the trading week, testing the $33 level. This is an area that’s been important a couple of times in the past but at this point in time it looks like it is still going to be thought of as a target. If we can break above there, then the market is likely to continue to go higher, perhaps opening up a move to the $35.50 level.
