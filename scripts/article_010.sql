    'Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewThe first trading day of the week saw major US equity indices advance for yet another day to reach new record high prices.Stock markets are continuing to look mostly bullish. Asian markets are mixed, European markets are more bullish, but the US market is the most bullish of all. The bullishness is especially notable in the US tech sector, withthe NASDAQ 100 Indextrading above and theS&P 500trading higher yesterday to make new record highs. The S&P 500 Index just had its best quarter since 2023, increasing in value by more than 10% since April began.

This has increased expectations of rate cuts over 2025 from 2 cuts of 0.25% to 3 cuts one at each remaining Fed meeting.The Forex market is showing increased price movement and volatility, with the declining US Dollar one of the main market drivers right now.

The Euro stands out for its long-term strength, especially as it just reached its highest level since 2014 against the Chinese Yuan. We also see the Swiss Franc (CHF) and the British Pound (GBP) reach new multi-year highs against the greenback.Silverremains bullish, although it is still some way off its recent high well above $37.President Trump is threatening Japan with higher tariffs unless it agrees to buy more imported rice from the USA.Later today there will be potentially high-impact data releases in the USA of:JOLTS Job OpeningsISM Manufacturing PMI',
