This could be decisive for the US Dollar, which is near long-term lows and a key support level. A higher-than-expected number will likely boost the greenback, while a lower than expected number could see it fall, although that would probably boost US stocks.Bitcoinis in focus again after making a new record high at $112,000 only two weeks ago. It went on to make a deep retracement, shaking out many trend traders, but yesterday finally made a notably strong rise, overcoming three key resistance levels. The price has made a natural retracement but is still trading around $110,000 easily within sight of the all-time high at $112,000. If the price closes above that level at the end of the New York session today, a lot of trend traders will get back in with long positions. The best way to invest in Bitcoin over the long-term is either by buying Bitcoin directly, buying a Bitcoin future (micro futures of only 0.1 Bitcoin are available on the CME), or a Bitcoin ETF (there are several, for example BITO).Silverand the precious metalPalladiumare consolidating after making new long-term highs on Monday.
