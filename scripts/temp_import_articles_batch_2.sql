    'How DeFi Is Disrupting & Revolutionizing the Forex [year]',
    'The total value locked on RWA tokenization platforms at the time of writing is over $12 billion. This includes tokenized stocks, treasuries, and bonds. RWA tokenization adds to the list of significant DeFi innovations that are relevant to mainstream finance and the over $2.4 quadrillion Forex market.On June 30, 2025, US-based brokerage platform, Robinhood, introduced tokenized OpenAI, SpaceX, as well as 200+ additional U.S. stocks for EU users, powered by Arbitrum’s Layer 2 blockchain. According to CEO Vlad Tenev, “Crypto is the next evolution of finance.”DeFi provides self-custody alternatives to mainstream finance, including the Forex market, and garnering attention from top players in traditional finance (TradFi). In this article, we discuss DeFi, how it is disrupting the Forex market, and its future in relation to traditional Finance.What Is DeFi?DeFi is an acronym for Decentralized Finance. It defines financial solutions built on the blockchain. DeFi applications leverage blockchain and decentralized protocols to build software that can be used for operations like lending, tokenization, trading, and yield farming. DeFi applications are self-custody applications, meaning that users maintain full control of their assets while interacting with the platform. They do not rely on third parties or a central administrator to function.DeFi Primitives Relevant to Forex and TradFiDeFi primitives are the foundational principles on which decentralized finance applications are built. Here are some of the major DeFi primitives relating specifically to TradFi and the Forex market.RWA Tokenization RWA (Real World Asset) tokenization creates a representation of mainstream commodities like national currencies, real estate, company shares, stocks, bonds, and precious metals on the blockchain.Stablecoins Stablecoins are tokens pegged to the value of a fiat currency.

    'How To Develop a Day Trading Strategy for Crypto [year]',
    'When I started day trading cryptocurrencies in 2022, I immediately had to incorporate key ideas and trading strategies to be successful.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewIn this article, I want to unpack the ideas that made me profitable as the cryptocurrencies swung up and down, developed trends and sometimes stayed in ranges. This knowledge and the strategies I adopted have been game-changers for me and many successful crypto traders.Let’s look at:Cryptocurrency day trading strategiesA step-by-step guideDos and Don’ts in day tradingWhat Is Crypto Day Trading?A cryptocurrency day trade involves entering a trading position in a cryptocurrency and then exiting the position in a short-term time frame, usually within the same day. For example, I buy Bitcoin at 10 a.m. and sell the position at 3 p.m. to complete a day trade.Cryptocurrency markets run 24/7 without an official opening or closing time each day. That means cryptocurrency day trading can happen at all hours of the day. The strict definition of day trading is to open and close a trading position on the same day. However, if a position remains open a little more than a day, I also classify that as day trading for the sake of this article.That means day trading has a short-term focus on immediate moves that require precise timing to catch.Why Day Trade Cryptos and Bitcoin?Liquidity and VolatilityThe best markets for day trading are those with liquidity and volatility. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are highly liquid and volatile, making them excellent for day trading.Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its market price. For an asset to be liquid, it must have a large market capitalization and plenty of trading volume. Bitcoin''s market capitalization was over $1 trillion in February 2024 and reached over $2 trillion one year later.But there’s no point in day trading a market if it barely moves in price, n',

    'Is Forex Trading Legal in Pakistan? Expert Analysis for 2024',
    'Forex trading has been growing rapidly in Pakistan in the last couple of years, with hundreds of traders joining in daily. However, there are always questions that new traders have in mind before getting in on the action of forex trading in Islam.Namely, these questions primarily revolve around if forex trading is legal in Pakistan and if it’s religiously approved according to Islamic law. This means that most Pakistani traders want to know if forex trading is legal according to Sharia law before they start trading.So, in this article, we will be covering all these important questions that Pakistani traders may have in mind. In addition to this, we will also be discussing the difference between unregulated and regulated brokers, so you’ll know which direction to go in before taking your first steps in forex.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewIs Forex Trading Legal in Pakistan?Let’s start with the most basic question—is it legal? The answer to that is yes, forex trading is totally legal in Pakistan.There are essentially no limits to forex trading in Pakistan. Of course, there has been some action taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) to reduce the risk of financial fraud and money laundering in the forex market. So far, we’ve covered only the legal aspect of forex trading in Pakistan.Is Forex Trading Legal According to Islamic Law?Although forex is legal according to Sharia law, there is a more complicated answer to this question. According to Islamic law, forex trading is halal as long as you keep a few important and morally-acceptable practices in mind.First of all, it is essential that you only use an interest-free forex account. As it is well known, interest is haram in Islam, and there is no exception to that rule. As such, it''s essential to understand how Pakistan taxes forex trades.Secondly, it is important that you avoid using online forex trading as a gambling tool. This means that yo',

    'Is retail Forex Dead? All You Need to Know - Updated [year]',
    'I’ll get right to the point: retail Forex is alive and kicking. It has plenty to offer retail traders of all experience levels, account sizes, and trading styles. I believe it will continue to do so for many generations to come. I will lay out my case for why I believe all traders should consider trading Forex.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow Retail Forex Revolutionized Retail TradingTo understand why retail Forex is alive, let’s look at how it’s revolutionized retail trading. I began trading Forex in the early 2000s. Before then, only institutions and high-net-worth individuals, usually requiring a minimum account size of $500,000, were able to trade currencies. At the time, most retail traders focused on equities and equity options, with a small proportion also trading futures contracts. When retail Forex emerged, it immediately exploded in popularity and quickly became the hot new thing.Retail traders had never seen an asset class like it, and Forex trading introduced many first experiences. For example, Forex was the first time many traders encountered leverage, and the first time they learned about over-the-counter markets that operated without centralized exchanges. In fact, because new Forex brokers advertised heavily to the public, retail Forex encouraged many to try trading for the first time.The emergence of retail Forex also helped increase the popularity of technical analysis methodology.Then, in 2005, MetaTrader 4 was introduced, specifically for Forex brokers. Before MetaTrader, most independent trading platforms required costly subscriptions or purchases. MetaTrader was free and used by almost all Forex brokers, making it immediately popular. Traders then started sharing MetaTrader trading templates (e.g., indicator settings) and automated systems (Expert Advisors), subscribing to signals and copying trades from other MetaTrader users. Suddenly, thanks to MetaTrader, many traders began collaborating',

    'NZD/USD Eyes Resistance Before RBNZ Rate Cut',
    'Following the RBNZ cutting its Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 50 basis points (bps) in November 2024, economists and investors expect another bumper 50 bp rate reduction on Wednesday this week – with an outside chance of a more minor 25 bp reduction. A 50 bp (25 bp) adjustment would bring the OCR to 3.75% (4.00%). In addition, markets are also expecting another 75 bps worth of cuts this year.Sluggish Economic ActivityI’ve observed little reason to stray from market pricing and expect an additional 50 bp cut this week. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth fell into a technical recession in Q3 24 after printing a second consecutive quarter in negative territory; the -1.5% contraction was the lowest figure since Q2 20. Additionally, unemployment has risen to its highest level since late 2020 at 5.1% (Q4 24), and given inflation remains within the RBNZ’s 1-3% target band – Q4 24 inflation increased to 2.2% (matching the 2.2% print in Q3 24) – the central bank has ‘room’ to lower the OCR.With a 50 bp cut largely baked in, and assuming the central bank follows through, I expect a knee-jerk sell-off across New Zealand dollar (NZD) pairs. That said, most focus will be on any change in the rate statement’s language, press conference commentary, and any revisions in the updated economic projections.NZD/USD Vulnerable to the DownsidePrice action on the monthly timeframe for the NZD/USD (New Zealand dollar versus the US dollar) came within a stone’s throw of testing long-term support from US$0.5511 this month. Anyone following candlestick patterns may note that the current monthly candle is poised to close by way of a bullish engulfing formation. While monthly support is clear, and the bullish engulfing pattern indicates buyers may want to explore higher terrain, the rebound in October 2022 failing to print a meaningful high may concern long-term bulls. Couple this with the overall long-term trend facing south, and any higher rebound could be short-lived.This brings me to the daily',

    'Tax on Forex Trading in South Africa [year]',
    'South Africa recognizes Forex trading as a legitimate activity, and the South African Revenue Services (SARS) requires South African residents to pay taxes on Forex trading profits. In short, all South African residents must declare their Forex profits for tax purposes, and there is no getting around it. Like most nations’ revenue-collecting services, SARS will impose penalties for not paying taxes.Let’s look at how SARS taxes Forex trading and explore some tax planning strategies that Forex traders can use.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow Are Forex Trading Profits Taxed in South Africa?Forex trading profits are subject to regular income tax rates in South Africa (unless an individual has set up a company for their Forex trading). Taxpayers can deduct trading-related expenses (e.g., computer equipment, trading courses, software, etc.) from their Forex profits to reduce their taxable income.SARS publishes the applicable “tax rates for individuals” here on its website. Individual tax rates are a progressive system with higher percentages at higher income levels. The lowest tax rate is 18%, and the highest is 45% above a specified income level. Each year, SARS adjusts the income levels for each percentage income tax rate.The Provisional Tax payment system applies to Forex trading profits because trading is not a salaried activity under the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax-paying system. Let’s examine how the Provisional Tax system works.What Is Provisional Tax?Forex trading gains are subject to the SARS “provisional tax” payment method.Although “provisional tax” sounds like a separate tax type, like income tax, or inheritance tax it is not. Instead, it is a method of spreading tax payments to SARS over the year instead of in one annual lump sum at the end of the tax year. SARS uses the provisional tax payment system to even out cash flow for taxpayers, rather than facing them with a large single payment at the end of the ye',

    'US Tariffs - Trump’s Tariffs and the Markets, [year, month]',
    'Markets have been roiled by US President Trump’s announcement of strong new tariffs on all trading partners, followed by a 90-day suspension. How this process plays out will be key to the future of the markets over 2025 and probably beyond.1. The Trump administration is committed to implementing tariffs.2. The administration is willing to enforce tariffs at levels that match the rhetoric.I believe this second realization, i.e., the sheer levels of the tariffs the U.S. was willing to enact, was the primary catalyst that caused much of the global equity markets’ sell-off in early April 2025.The proposed tariff levels are massively uneven among nations, depending on the Trump administration’s view of how specific nations contribute to a trade deficit. Negotiations between world leaders and Trump’s team are happening at a pace that alters the landscape daily.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewWhere We Stand NowAt the time of writing, Trump paused global reciprocal tariffs for 90 days from April 9, with one notable exception: China. His pause followed days of equity and bond markets'' sell-off that could have led to a financial meltdown, and the U.S. public would have widely considered Trump responsible in such an event. In my mind, Trump’s team underestimated the market decline and loss of public support that would follow the tariff announcements, hence the abrupt pause.However, the Trump administration will seemingly continue a baseline 10% tariff on most nations that started on April 5. Had it not been for the extra tariffs and market volatility, this alone would be a headline news item.The exception for China is stark. Currently, the U.S. has set a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, and China has retaliated with an 84% tariff on U.S. goods—numbers that would have been unthinkable a week ago. The U.S. is in a trade war with China, with neither country wishing to back down, and neither country has an off-ramp. This is uncharted t',

    'How to Count Pips on US30? Experts US30 Pip Calculator Guide',
    'What is the US30?US30 is a common ticker name for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The DJIA is a major stock average in the USA which is always composed of 30 publicly traded companies listed on US stock exchanges.The DJIA has been around for a long time. It was first created as an indicator to gauge the state of the American stock market in the late 19th century. However, it has been somewhat overtaken by broader, more modern stock indices such as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100 indices. In particular, the S&P 500 Index has taken the DJIA’s old role as the barometer of the American stock market.The DJIA is price weighted, unlike modern stock indices, which are weighted by market capitalisation.The DJIA’s member companies are typically old “blue chip” companies which are involved in industrial processes, and as such, is somewhat less relevant to the modern American economy, which has become increasingly service based since the 1960s.What Is One Pip Change in US30?A pip change is the measurement used for change amounts within an exchange rate of a currency pair. It’s calculated from the last decimal point. Most major currency pairs are priced to within four decimal places, so the smallest change could be 1/100 or one percent (0.0001), which is one basis point.However, currency crosses for the Japanese Yen (EUR/JPY) have a pip of 0.01. For metals like silver and gold, a pip is 0.01 on the US30.Here’s an example: the GBP/USD moves from 1.3935 to 1.3936, so there is one pip change. If you’re using a five-digit broker and the GBP/USD moves from 1.39355 to 1.39360, there’s a half a pip change (0.5 pip).Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow to Measure Pips in BTC/USD on US30When measuring pips for BTC/USD pairs on the US30, it’s similar to when you’re trading gold - XAU/USD.

    'Why Every Country Is Racing to Launch a Central Bank Digital',
    'Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are tipped as the most significant monetary shift in 50 years, since the US left the gold standard in 1971. As of 2025, 137 countries, making up 98% of global GDP, are engaged in researching, developing, and piloting national CBDCs.Governments are racing to launch digital currencies into their economies to avoid being left behind in an industry predicted to reach $213 billion in transaction volume by 2030.In the article, you’ll learn why countries are launching CDBCs, how China’s e-CNY is leading the way, and the challenges facing central banks in their quest for digital transformation.What is a CBDC?A Central Bank Digital Currency or ‘CDBC’ is a digital form of a sovereign nation''s legal currency. Most often, they are blockchain-based cryptocurrencies that are issued and controlled by governments or central authorities. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, a government-issued CDBC is legal tender and can be used for payments of goods or services.The concept of CDBCs is still relatively new, and very few nations have actually launched this new style of digital money. Most countries are still developing, testing, and piloting CDBCs, but they are likely to be officially implemented with increasing speed over the coming years.While the architecture is still being designed, most will rely on a two-tier system where a country''s central bank issues the coins, and commercial banks are responsible for distribution. CBDCs rely on blockchain technology to deliver 24/7, instant settlement, while smart contracts enable deeper levels of financial automation.Motivations for CBDC AdoptionA big attraction for governments is the traceability and transaction history recorded on a blockchain network. This provides complete traceability for ‘digital cash’ compared to traditional notes and coins, which are not traceable.Centralized control is a significant factor in the distinction between CDBCs and traditional cryptocurrencies.

    'How Market Volatility Affects Execution',
    'Volatility is a hot topic for financial educators, traders, and investors. If you are unfamiliar with the term, it refers to a scenario where market prices rapidly rise and drop within a very short period. Depending on their trading or investing style, some skilled or even professional traders may actively avoid or choose to trade during volatility. Although potential rewards may be more significant during volatility, the risk increases exponentially.Although there is no direct correlation between volatility and execution, trying to open a trade while prices are moving rapidly can lead to price differences between what a trader expects and what they get. It’s like trying to hit a rapidly moving target with a ball, something that’s relatively challenging. In the best-case scenario, your trade may open at a more beneficial rate. In the worst-case scenario, your trade opens at a rate that causes unforeseen losses or yields a smaller return than intended.Exness helps traders mitigate this by filling their orders at the best market price available at the given moment. Thanks to a robust infrastructure of strategically located servers worldwide, their order execution* is both fast and reliable.What causes volatility?Several factors fuel volatility, but in simple terms, it occurs when traders are unsure about an event, news item, or political occurrence that will affect the markets. Here’s a more specific breakdown of these factors.NewsInformation can come from any source, but as long as it reaches an audience of market participants likely to spread market-moving news, that information can have an impact. These include traditional financial media like Forbes, Bloomberg, and the Wall Street Journal, as well as social media and trading communities like those on Discord.GeopoliticsDuring the beginning of 2025, the new US administration waffled on tariffs. The enacted ones triggered retaliatory tariffs from the targeted countries, resulting in volatility as markets feared a ra',

    'Understanding trading costs & how PrimeXBT stands out',
    'Trading fees are often accepted as part of the cost of trading — a necessary friction in an otherwise fluid market. But for serious traders, these costs are more than incidental — they’re a performance lever.However, the true cost of trading goes beyond visible charges. It’s embedded in the structure behind each trade — from slippage and spread behavior to platform reliability under pressure. In this sense, cost-efficiency isn’t just about low fees — it’s about the structural integrity of the entire trading experience.This is where PrimeXBT stands out. With low fees, a transparent pricing model, and a stable, high-performance platform, it delivers cost efficiency by design. Its VIP Tiers program plays a central role in that structure — helping traders save more when they trade.What traders often overlookWhile most traders pay attention to headline fees like commissions or taker rates, many of other costs live in the background.Latency, the time it takes for a trade to execute, can quietly affect entry and exit points.Slippage, the difference between expected and actual execution price, becomes especially costly in volatile markets.Spread widening during news events or low-liquidity periods can inflate the cost of a trade well beyond what was anticipated.Platform overload is when a platform lags or freezes during high-activity moments, the result isn’t just frustration — it''s a missed opportunity.These aren’t hypothetical scenarios. For active traders, they’re part of the daily reality — and they add up.That’s why low fees alone aren’t enough — and experienced traders know it. Some platforms advertise “zero commission” models but quietly make up for it with wide spreads, restricted access to tools, or hidden charges. Others place essential features behind paywalls or limit asset access unless higher account types are unlocked.How PrimeXBT is built differentlyPrimeXBT addresses the hidden friction points of trading with infrastructure built for speed, stability, and c',

MT4 was and remains a leading trading solution for forex and CFD traders because of its speed, stability, and array of technical tools.By integrating this trusted platform, the company gave its clients a reliable research and trading management environment with features like one-click trading and customisable charting, and highlighting the belief that every trader deserves access to world-class tools.Compliance was another early pillar for the broker. Obtaining its first regulatory licence not only enabled the company to operate in reputable jurisdictions but also helped build trust among its expanding user base. Financial regulation requires rigorous policies on funds segregation and transparency, to name a few. The early commitment to being a regulated broker set a standard for reliable operation that has been sustained ever since.Offices were opened in major financial centres, including London, Sydney, and Johannesburg, to meet international demand. Establishing a physical presence in these locations meant the company could serve clients with local expertise and faster support, in addition to building a network that at',

    'Forex Today: Markets Expect US Inflation Unchanged Today',
    'Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe focus will shift today to the release of US CPI (inflation) data, with the annualized rate expected to remain unchanged.Markets will be focusing today on the upcoming release of US CPI (inflation) data. It is widely expected that the annualized rate will remain unchanged at 2.4%, with month-on-month CPI expected to show an increase of 0.3%. If the data is higher than expected, that could boost the USD and sink US stocks; if lower than expected, the opposite will be likely.The big news yesterday was the announcement of a trade deal between the USA and China, who have been engaged in a noisy and destructive trade war since Trump took office in January. It was agreed that during an upcoming 90-day period for further negotiations, the US would drop tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China would drop tariffs on US imports from 125% to 10%. The US Dollar and US stock markets immediately jumped and held these increases, with the NASDAQ 100 Index up by 4.4% on the day and the S&P 500 Index closing higher by 3.3%. Asian stock markets have mostly continued this rally, although Chinese indices are trading lower today. This news is likely to be bullish for global risk-on sentiment generally, including stock markets.Following yesterday''s trade deal between the USA and China, markets are now expecting only 2 US rate cuts over the course of 2025, at 0.25% each, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The first cut is not expected until September.In the Forex market, since today''s Tokyo open, the Australian Dollar has been the strongest major currency, while the USD has been the weakest, putting the AUD/USD currency pair in focus - the Aussie typically gains when global risk sentiment improves. However, it can be said that the USD strength we saw yesterday is likely to hold up over the coming days.Bitcoin dropped quite sharply yesterday after coming close to testing its record high made',

    'US Inflation Unchanged but Core CPI Accelerates',
    'The US consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-on-year in July, unchanged from the June figure and below the market estimate of 2.8%. CPI remained at its lowest annual inflation rate since February 2021. Monthly CPI eased, rising to 0.2% from 0.3%, in line with market expectations. Gasoline and fuel oil prices continued to decline sharply, a key factor in easing inflation.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, moved in the opposite direction. Annual CPI climbed to 3.1% in July, up from 2.9% and above the market estimate of 3.0%. This marked the highest level in five months. Monthly, the core rate rose 0.3%, up from 0.2% and in line with the market estimate.The rise in core CPI reflects the effect of Trump''s tariffs, which took effect in April and continue to filter through the economy. The tariffs are expected to dampen growth and raise inflation, as US consumers pay more for imported goods.Inflation Report Likely Cements Rate Cut in SeptemberThe Federal Reserve has been on an extended pause and hasn''t lowered interest rates since December 2024. That is expected to change at the next Fed meeting, barring an extreme surprise. The markets have currently priced in a 94% likelihood of a rate cut at the Sep. 17 meeting, up sharply from 84% just before the inflation release. Investors were clearly relieved that CPI remained at 2.7% and didn''t rise to 2.8% as expected, anticipating that this will clear the path for the Fed to lower rates next month.US Dollar Shows Muted Response, Stock Market Edges Higher after Inflation ReportThe US dollar is showing little reaction following the release of the US inflation report, while the US stock market is in positive territory.The GBP/USD currency pair is trading at 1.3482, up 0.35% on the day, but most of these gains were recorded ahead of the inflation release.The US stock market has posted gains on Tuesday, as investors reacted positively to the inflation report.The S&P 500',

The pair continued to move around the 34.50 lira levels without any significant improvement or decline after the interest rate decision issued by the Turkish Central Bank last Thursday, which kept the interest rate unchanged for the eighth consecutive time at 50%. Moreover, the Central Bank''s decision did not contradict the expectations that prevailed in the markets.The decision came with the aim of continuing to curb inflation, which showed a higher rise than market expectations over the months of September and October. Despite the continued monetary tightening, the bank''s statement issued after the interest rate decision did not overlook pointing to the approaching cycle of easing monetary policy in the near future. Bank analysts "Goldman Sachs" and "Morgan Stanley" expect this phase to begin next month, or by the beginning of next year, 2025. Obviously, these expectations may be closer to realization if inflation rates for the month of November record a significant decline compared to previous months.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewFurthermore, the data issued over the past months showed a continued decline in inflation in the country, but it was a disappointing slo',

As of January 20, 2025, opening and renewing protected accounts with maturities of six and 12 months will be stopped, according to a statement by the central bank. The statement also explained that this step aims to reduce the protected deposit program, which was launched in December 2021 to support the stability of the Turkish lira and reduce dollarization. The program, which guaranteed depositors protection against exchange rate fluctuations, was criticized for its high cost and negative impact on the budget.

Recently, the Central Bank of Turkey has adopted a strategy aimed at enhancing the attractiveness of the Turkish lira to investors by offering high returns. Obviously, this strategy is based on allowing the lira to depreciate against the dollar but ensuring that the rate of depreciation is less than the inflation rate. Furthermore, this approach aims to reduce the impact of currency weakness on rising prices.Over the past year, the lira has depreciated by 16% against the dollar in nominal terms. However, when taking inflation into account, the lira recorded significant gains, the best since 2007. This policy provided a unique opportunity for foreign investors, as they could achieve returns of over 50% by investing in Turkish lira bonds, making it one of the most attractive options in the financial markets.At the same time, the report indicated an improvement in the value of the lira, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan',

Meanwhile, the dollar price in Turkey recorded record levels during the past weekend after the pair rose to 36.53 lira levels. While it recorded 36.40 levels at the time of writing the report. The current rise pattern of the pair reflects the extent of the monetary and financial authorities'' control in Turkey over the lira''s movements, which are declining in a limited and similar pattern daily. Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated during the weekend that the Central Bank''s reserves recorded their highest level ever after exceeding 173 billion dollars, while his country''s share of the global economy rose to about 1.1% compared to the 0.7% recorded previously.

    'SilverSilver has been back and forth during the course of the trading week, testing the $33 level. This is an area that’s been important a couple of times in the past but at this point in time it looks like it is still going to be thought of as a target. If we can break above there, then the market is likely to continue to go higher, perhaps opening up a move to the $35.50 level. Short-term pullbacks should continue to be potential buying opportunities in this market, as it obviously has a lot of underlying upward pressure. I don’t think things change very quickly.GoldGold markets continue to be very noisy, and it is worth noting that we did sell off during the day on Thursday, but quite frankly I think this is a market that any time we get some type of decent pullback, people will be willing to step in and pick up “cheap gold.” I believe that the $3200 level underneath is a significant support level, as it was significant previously, and then after that we have the $3000 level that could offer a bit of a short-term floor as well. After all, there is a large, round, psychologically significant aspect of that level.WTI Crude OilThe West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil market has a definite air of positivity under it, with the $60 level offering support. The market looks as if it is going to try to get to the $65 level sooner rather than later, and if we can break above there, it’s very possible that the WTI Crude Oil market could break even higher than that, perhaps making a run toward the $70 level. All things being equal, this is a market that I think will remain very noisy, as people are trying to sort out whether or not they are going to see the man pick up in the near future, because quite frankly, we have bounce from a major support level.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewBitcoinBitcoin has tried to rally during the week, but gave back a bit of the gains, as we continue to see this market go back and forth and try to',

    'USD/JPYThe US dollar initially fell against the Japanese yen but has found enough support near the 140 level to turn things around and bounce quite significantly. It’s interesting, because the 140 level has been a major support level going back some time now, and it’s also worth noting that the 200 Week EMA sits there as well. By forming this massive hammer, and the fact that some of the rhetoric out there has gone off the rails, it’s starting to look more and more like the US dollar is in the process of bottoming. Furthermore, the Japanese yen looks like it is giving up some of that strength.USD/CHFThe US dollar initially fell during the course of the week to break down below the 0.81 level, only to turn around and bounce all the way toward the 0.83 level. The US dollar looks like it is ready to rally from here, but whether or not it can change the overall trend is a completely different question. If we can break above the 0.84 level, then I think we have a situation where we could rise as high as 0.8750 level. However, if we turn around a breakdown below the weekly candlestick, then we could drop to the 0.80 level eventually.GBP/USDThe British pound has rallied significantly during the course of the week, but it found the 1.34 level to be far too resistant to continue. By doing so, we ended up forming a bit of a shooting star. This is a market that is overbought, so a pullback makes quite a bit of sense at this point in time. In fact, I am seeing this across the board when it comes to the US dollar, so I think all things are leading to the same scenario, where the greenback is suddenly going to strengthen. That being said, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the British pound will fall apart, just that we have certainly gotten too far ahead of ourselves. However, if we were to break above the 1.34 level on a weekly close, we could really start to accelerate to the upside.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThere are',

The Central Bank continues to intervene amidst the sharp fluctuations witnessed in global markets due to statements by US President Donald Trump, ranging from passing tariff increases to postponing them for 90 days. Consequently, these fluctuations have widened a wave of intense foreign capital outflows. During the period between March 14th and 28th, outflows of 14 billion dollars were recorded from foreign investment portfolios.According to data published on X, the Turkish Central Bank injected approximately 10.7 billion dollars from its foreign currency reserves in just two days, distributed between 7.6 billion dollars on April 7th and 3.1 billion dollars on the 8th of this month. This brings the total amount spent by the Turkish government since the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu on March 19th to about 42.7 billion dollars, in an attempt to contain the deterioration of the',

Negotiations will be ongoing until the 90-day period ends in early July.The big news last week was the European Central Bank’s rate cut of 0.25%, which was widely expected, and the optimism that inflation is now well on course to settle long-term at about the target level of 2%. The ECB seems to feel quite confident that it has inflation beaten, and ironically this may be boosting the Euro as a new safe-haven currency.Another major item was lower than expected inflation in both the UK and in Canada, which is adding to the growing “inflation beaten” narrative.The Bank of Canada held its Overnight Rate at 2.75%.US Retail Sales data came in a little stronger than expected.Finally, President Trump has been publicly criticizing Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting rates more quickly, and is publicly musing on studying replacing him, although it is hard to see how this could be executed.
