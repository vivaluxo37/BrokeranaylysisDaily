    'Fundamental Analysis & Market SentimentI wrote on 8th June that the best trades for the week would be:Long of the GBP/USD currency pair after a daily (New York) close above $1.3616. This did not set up.Long of Silver in USD terms. This closed 0.78% higher over the week.Long of the S&P 500 Index pair after a daily (New York) close above 6,142.

However, the missiles which get through cause serious damage and fatalities, although at a level the Israeli public can probably accept, at least for a few more days or weeks.It seems clear that the Iranian regime and nuclear program is in serious jeopardy, the nuclear program more so, and Iran has a limited supply of perhaps 2,000 ballistic missiles that it may not be able to replenish. The big question is whether the Americans will join in the drive to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, or whether Iran might sue for a negotiated settlement that would be acceptable to the USA.Th',
