Average Hourly Earnings growth was also lower than expected, at 0.2% month-on-month. After the negative Advance GDP print earlier in the week, Trump had a fairly strong case to start calling again for rate cuts, and he reiterated his call a few hours ago while stating that Fed Chair Powell is safe in his role until 2026. Trump has no real power to fire Powell anyway.Stock markets are mixed today, with Asian markets mostly higher, while US equity index futures are trading lower off-hours since markets opened this week in Asia.Bitcoinbriefly broke above the key resistance level at $95,038 but has again fallen back to trade below the big round number at $95,000.

It was agreed that during an upcoming 90-day period for further negotiations, the US would drop tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China would drop tariffs on US imports from 125% to 10%.

The first cut is not expected until September.In the Forex market, since today''s Tokyo open, the Australian Dollar has been the strongest major currency, while the USD has been the weakest, puttingthe AUD/USD currency pairin focus - the Aussie typically gains when global risk sentiment improves. However, it can be said that the USD strength we saw yesterday is likely to hold up over the coming days.Bitcoindropped quite sharply yesterday after coming close to testing its record high made a few months ago after making a bullish breakout beyond its former key resistance level at $95,206.

Many analysts see the failure of President Trump''s tax bill in Congress and a perceived push towards a weaker Dollar at the G7 meeting underway in Canada as factors driving the greenback lower.In the Forex market the strongest major currency since the Tokyo open has been the Swiss Franc, while theCanadian Dollarhas been the weakest.

It went on to make a deep retracement, shaking out many trend traders, but yesterday finally made a notably strong rise, overcoming three key resistance levels. The price has made a natural retracement but is still trading around $110,000 easily within sight of the all-time high at $112,000. If the price closes above that level at the end of the New York session today, a lot of trend traders will get back in with long positions. The best way to invest in Bitcoin over the long-term is either by buying Bitcoin directly, buying a Bitcoin future (micro futures of only 0.1 Bitcoin are available on the CME), or a Bitcoin ETF (there are several, for example BITO).Silverand the precious metalPalladiumare consolidating after making new long-term highs on Monday.
