    'GoldGold markets initially fell during the course of the week but then turned around to show signs of strength. Quite frankly, we still have a lot of noise out there when it comes to tariff wars, and when you look at the longer-term charts, it’s obvious that we have seen so much in the way of upward momentum that it only can go sideways for a while, working off some of the excess froth. Currently, we are trading in the middle of the overall consolidation range between $3200 on the bottom, and the $3500 level at the top.SilverSilver has broken above a major resistance barrier in the form of $37.50, an area that has been difficult to get above the month. Ultimately, short-term pullbacks will end up being buying opportunities in this market, and if we can pull back toward the $37.50 level, then I think you have a real shot at the market finding a bit of “market memory” in this area. Based on the “measured move” of the previous consolidation, it’s likely that silver will try to get to the $40 level above.DAXThe German index DAX rally during most of the week and even managed to pierce above the €24,500 level. The market breaking above that level was a bullish sign, but we have given back some of these gains, so I think we are still very much in the way of consolidation. Looking at this chart, the €23,500 level should be thought of as a short-term floor, and I think it makes a lot of sense that we go sideways for a little bit before continuing the overall uptrend as Germany tends to lead the way for the European Union.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThe euro fell during the course of the week, as we are a little bit overdone at this point, and a pullback from here probably opens up the possibility of a move down to the 1.16 level. The 1.16 level is an area that previously had been resistant, and therefore it makes a certain amount of sense that the market sees that as a potential floor. If we break down below there,',

    'GoldGold markets have initially fell a bit during the trading week but have turned around to show signs of life again as the market looks like it is still stuck in the middle of a major consolidation range, which is bordered by $3200 at the bottom, and the $3500 level at the top. Ultimately, I do still believe that gold goes higher over the longer term, but we still have a lot of work to do in order to break out. This time of year, is quite often very quiet, so what I am seeing now is not a huge surprise. Buying the dip continues to be the way forward.EUR/USDThe euro plunged during the beginning of the week but has found enough support just below the 1.16 level to turn things around somewhat. This is a market that’s been very bullish for a while, and therefore a bit of a pullback probably made sense. If we were to break down below the 1.15 level, then we could start to talk about a turnaround, but right now I believe we have a situation where we continue to see a lot of noisy trading, but as things stand right now, the uptrend is still very intact.NASDAQ 100The NASDAQ 100 has been bullish during the week, breaking above a neutral candlestick from the previous one. At this point in time, the market is very bullish, and we have hit a fresh, new all-time high, and therefore I think we’ve got a scenario where the just simply need to see some type of reason to continue the upward trajectory. Pullbacks at this point in time are still very possible, with the 22,250 level being a significant level on the charts that will almost certainly offer a bit of support on any dip. At this point, the NASDAQ 100 means extraordinarily bullish.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewGBP/USDThe British pound has fallen pretty significantly during the trading week, to reach down toward the 1.3350 level, an area that has been important in the past, so I do believe that this is a market that is trying to find a bit of a bottom after falling apart.

    'DAXThe German index DAX had a very back and forth week over the last 5 trading sessions as we continue to see the €24,600 level offer a pretty significant barrier. If we were to break above that level, then it’s likely that the market will just simply continue the overall long trend. That being said, we have recently seen a massive jump higher, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we have spent this time consolidating. This is especially true, considering that the time of year is fairly quiet for a lot of markets to begin with.CopperCopper had another explosive week, as we continue to get trade headlines, and of course traders start to price in the idea of copper being a major component of artificial intelligence, so this is a different market that was just a few years ago. The market is very strong, but we also gave back quite a bit of the gains late in the week, so I think this is a situation where you probably look for dips to continue buying copper from a longer-term standpoint with particular interest paid to the $5.50 level, and then the $5.20 level.SilverSilver initially rallied during the week but got absolutely clobbered near the $40 level. The resulting candlestick is a very ugly shooting star, but it’s worth noting that the previous 2 candlesticks were a large, explosive, positive candlestick, followed by a hammer. In other words, there is a lot of noise in this area, and I think you continue to see a lot of back and forth trading more than anything else. With that being the case, the market is just simply trying to sort out whether or not we have enough momentum to go higher. I would not be looking to short this market.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewGoldGold markets rallied a bit during the week to reach just below the $3500 level but got clobbered as we have seen an absolute hammering of price.

    'SOL price is up 3% over the last 24 hours and 35% over the last 30 days to trade at $194 at the time of writing. Analysts are optimistic that Solana will continue rallying, first reaching toward $250 in the short term before challenging the all-time highs at $295 and into price discovery.This optimism is driven by expectations that a US-based spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) could soon become a reality and surging institutional interest.Solana ETF Approval Odds Hit 99% on PolymarketThe prospect of a spot Solana ETF has become a focal point for crypto investors, with the likelihood of the US Securities and Exchange Commission approving (SEC) approving a spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2025 jumping to 99.7% on July 2, according to Polymarket data.The odds currently stand at 99% at the time of writing on Monday, signaling investor confidence in Solana’s future in traditional financial markets.Solana ETF Approval Odds on Polymarket. Source: PolymarketThis surge in confidence follows a series of developments that signal a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment.Major asset managers, including VanEck, Grayscale, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, have filed applications for Solana ETFs with the SEC, signaling strong market demand for regulated SOL investment vehicles.Bloomberg senior ETF analyst James Seyffart has noted that the SEC’s recent interactions with issuers are a positive sign, despite delays in decisions, such as Fidelity Investments’ spot Solana application.Seyffart expects a “wave of new ETFs” in the second half of 2025, with Solana leading the charge alongside other altcoins.He places Solana ETF approval odds at 95%, according to a July 1 post on the X social media platform.Analysts’ Odds on Crypto ETFS: Source: James SeyffartThe shift in SEC leadership further bolsters the optimism surrounding Solana’s ETF approval.

    'The S&P 500 has been very bullish heading into the month of July, and it looks very much like a market that is trying to break out to higher levels.That being said, the market is a little stretched going into the beginning of the month, so I am anticipating a little bit of a short-term pullback in order to offer enough value for traders to get involved in.Furthermore, the month of August is typically very negative as far as volume is concerned, so it would make a certain amount of sense that we might drift a little bit lower during the month, only to turn around and show signs of strength again.Support BarriersTop Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewI believe that there is a significant amount of support near the $6300 level, but I also recognize that the $6150 level could offer support. Somewhere in that general vicinity, I would love to see a pullback, followed by a bounce that I can start buying. That being said, if we break down below the $6000 level, then things might be changing. However, I suspect that you will know that some type of external pressure is being applied to the market, and therefore you can just simply trade according to the overall risk appetite sentiment.However, the market bouncing the way it has from the beginning of April suggest that there are plenty of buyers out there willing to get involved, even if we are a little overdone. To the upside, I would anticipate that the $6500 level could be a bit of a target, and if we can break above there then I think buyers will jump in and try to take advantage of the overall uptrend. I have no interest in shorting the market, at least not until we break down below the $6000 level, and even then, I would need to have an actual reason. We could have a bit of a “zombie rally” going through the month, meaning that we just simply drift higher in a very slow and methodical manner.Ready to trade our monthly forecast?

The USD/INR is traversing within sight of record heights seen on the 10th of February, this when the USD/INR came close to the 88.0000 level. The USD/INR is trading for the moment around 87.5400 with fast action. Yesterday’s price velocity higher was triggered when President Trump began aiming strong tariff rhetoric towards India, when he apparently became convinced that the nation was not going to cooperate in a manner he deemed correct.India apparently is remaining stubborn regarding tariff negotiations, and the U.S White House is not backing down from its stance that India must lower its import duties on U.S products. President Trump has stated India faces a tariff of 25% if it does not bend its trade policy. Prime Minister Modi appears to be in a difficult position because he risk political problems in the Indian legislature due to promises made to those who have been supporting Modi’s political party – the Bharatiya Janata Party.Implications and Intrigue with the USD/INRIf Prime Minister Modi changes his stance regarding his trade policies within the BJP it could cause political instability and weakness in the next election. The USD/INR went from nearly 86.8000 yesterday to a high of 87.8080 with strong price velocity when President Trump began his rhetoric assault. Via Trump’s public messages yesterday on social media, the White House made it clear that the tariff stance is not only about trade between the U.S and India, but also India’s energy policy with Russia that is not seen favorably by the Trump administration. India is a large buyer of Russian energy and this will be hard to change.The tactic of scolding India publicly about its energy policy will not be warmly received in India and could cause Prime Minister Modi to make a public stance that is uncomfortable.

If a trader somehow was not paying attention to global news and the Forex markets, they would assume everything has been calm and normal trading has been seen. However, the Middle East conflict between Iran and Israel that escalated on the 13th of June certainly caused widespread concerns, and India’s financial assets including the Indian Rupee were directedly effected.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe USD/INR had been trading near the 85.5300 ratio on the 12th of June, then as the war between Iran and Israel began to make news on the 13th, there was a gap higher and the 18.26000 realm was quickly hit.

In fact the USD/INR in essence only tested highs seen in the second week of April when tariff rhetoric from the U.S White House was influencing Forex. It is also important to note the reversal lower which developed immediately upon the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel was very strong and also correlated to the broad Forex market.By Tuesday of last week the USD/INR fell below the 86.0000 level and continued to incrementally sell off.

    'The US dollar has been very choppy during the month of July against the Mexican peso, as we are searching for some type of directionality from here.I suspect that we will see more of the same noise in August, mainly due to the fact that August is typically a fairly quiet month to begin with, and this is a pair that is something that is highly specialized for a certain part of the world and a certain trading session.After all, there is very little volume in the USD/MXN pair outside of the North American session, and therefore the fact that Wall Street is going away for vacation could very well put this pair in a consolidation move.Technical AnalysisTop Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewAs far as the technical analysis is concerned, it’s obvious that we have been very negative for the majority of 2025. I don’t think that changes anytime soon, but a little bit of a bounce would make a certain amount of sense. The 19 MXN level above is a significant area due to the large, round, psychologically significant figure in and of itself, and of course the 200 Week EMA is sitting right there as well. Ultimately, this is a scenario where market participants continue to look at this through the prism of the interest rate differential favoring Mexico, and of course the fact that the Mexican peso tends to do fairly well when the US economy does.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewKeep in mind that Mexico is the largest exporter to the United States, so if the US economy continues to be very strong, that almost certainly will help the Mexican economy as so much of its goods end up in the United States. With that being said, I think that we may get a little bit of a bounce, but I’m still looking to play short-term rallies to show signs of exhaustion, opening up an assault and attack on the 18.50 MXN level underneath, where we have of course found the little bit of support.Ready to trade our monthly forecast?

While the U.S, Japan and the E.U have seemingly produced agreed upon trading mandates, a host of other nations are still trying to define terms and South Africa is among them.

Some traders may be tempted to believe the currency pair looks overbought, but the near-term may continue to produce choppy elevated conditions.Sentiment Shifts and the USD/ZAR WatersTrading in the USD/ZAR has been quite comfortable in July.

This is a win for President Trump, although the bill has been criticized as fiscally irresponsible by many on the right.Sentiment was certainly boosted by the much stronger jobs and average hourly earnings data released in the USA on Thursday, which sent stock markets soaring as the data showed a much stronger than expected economy.Although sentiment was risk-on last week, the sentiment is showing signs of slowing, and this is probably because Trump’s tariffs are now starting to come back into focus, with the coming Wednesday 9th July being Trump’s deadline for trade deals or higher tariffs, although President Trump has indicated he might extend the deadline again for at least some countries.It does seem likely that President Trump will announce the exact rates of steeper tariffs which will start to apply Wednesday from early next week, and where there are no deal or bad deals, we could see some volatility in the stock markets and currencies of those countries, as we did earlier in 2025 when Trump’s higher tariffs first started being imposed..Other market drivers last week related to certain high-impact data releases:US Average Hourly Earnings – this was expected to show a lower month-on-month increase of only 0',

President Trump announced the following last week on tariffs:A 50% tariff on all copper imports – this sent copper futures soaring to new record highs, which will have been of interest to trend and momentum traders.A 50% tariff on Brazilian imports – this has been exacerbated by Brazil’s strong positions within BRICs and against key aspects of American foreign policy.An additional 10% tariff on all nations deemed to align with BRICs.These measures likely gave a boost to the US Dollar, which had an uncharacteristic strong week last week, and hit the Brazilian Real. However, overall, these items were unable to stop the two major US equity indices, the broad S&P 500 Index and the tech-focused NASDAQ 100 Index, from reaching new record highs, albeit on slowing momentum.Other market drivers last week related to certain high-impact data releases:RBA Cash Rate & Rate Statement – the RBA was expected to cut rates by 0.25%, but surprisingly left its Cash Rate unchanged, saying that the time was not quite right to cut due to inflation.

Today’s price has moved between $839 and $865, with intraday dips quickly met by buyers.This stability follows a period of heavy accumulation by larger players. Notably, CEA Industries purchased 200,000 BNB this month, adding to bullish sentiment.That buying activity has reinforced the $830–$835 zone as a critical line of defense for bulls, which turns it into a key support area.The wider crypto market is providing a supportive backdrop. Bitcoin is consolidating above $121,000, and Ethereum is steady near $4,741. The absence of sharp pullbacks in majors is allowing BNB to maintain momentum without facing aggressive profit-taking pressure.$830 Support and $865 Resistance Define the Current RangeThe immediate support for BNB now sits in the $830–$835 band. This range has already absorbed several profit-taking events this week, proving its importance for short-term stability.If price breaks below this level, the next area of interest is $802–$805, a pivot zone marked by prior consolidation.Resistance is building at $860–$865. Sellers have repeatedly capped rallies here in recent sessions. A close above $865 on strong volume would signal a potential push to $880–$900.Breaking $900 could trigger follow-on buying from momentum traders and test historical resistance zones seen in earlier market cycles.Technical Indicators Suggest Momentum With Caution SignsMomentum remains on the side of buyers, though some indicators are showing early signs of overheating.

    'Cryptocurrency bulls are back on the advance after a couple of weeks in which bears made a concerted effort to reclaim the ground lost in July. Since hitting a record high above $123,000 on July 14, Bitcoin (BTC) entered a period of consolidation, largely holding above $118,000, before world events helped bears drive the price of King Crypto to a low of $111,940 on August 3.Since then, bulls have taken control, stair-stepping BTC back above $119,000 to hit a high of $122,290 on Monday, and are looking poised to push into uncharted territory.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewAiding bulls in their efforts was the Tuesday release of the July US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which showed inflation holding at 2.7% year-over-year, unchanged from June and below the 2.8% forecast.The boost in Bitcoin’s price comes as market watchers continue to increase their expectations for a September Fed interest rate cut, with the CME FedWatch tool indicating a 94.2% probability of a 25-basis-point cut. While the CPI data shows that inflation remains above the Fed’s target rate of 2%, many hope that the improvement thus far will convince them to lower rates and ease financial pressures.Cryptos also saw a spike in prices and trading volume after U.S. President Donald Trump directed financial regulators to expand access to alternative investments in 401(k) plans, including digital assets and privately owned companies.According to market analyst Merlijn The Trader, the ensuing recovery marked the end of Bitcoin accumulation, and up next comes the face-melting parabolic phase.Bitcoin Accumulation is over.

Following the start of the Trump-Putin summit late last week, the EUR/USD pair recovered to the 1.1715 resistance level, close to its highest point in two weeks. Forecasters expect the euro to benefit if US President Donald Trump is able to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.The foreign exchange market''s focus is on the meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where a significant breakthrough on a ceasefire is hoped for. A ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine would be a crucial turning point, as it could significantly strengthen the euro by boosting economic activity in the Eurozone through lower energy prices and improved consumer and business confidence. However, this is not a core expectation.It''s unrealistic to expect a deal on Friday, but there''s a strong possibility that it could pave the way for an eventual end to the conflict. According to performance across trusted trading platforms, with the euro rising by 12.75% against the US dollar by 2025, further gains are possible if geopolitical risks centered on Europe''s eastern flank dissipate.Resolving the Ukraine Crisis Will Strengthen the EuroRussia''s invasion of Ukraine marked a turning point for the European economy, which was highly dependent on Russian hydrocarbons.

    'The British pound has rallied a bit against the U S dollar during the trading session here on Wednesday, as we have broken towards the 1.36 level, the 1.36 level is a large round psychologically significant figure and an area that has been important a couple of times.If we can break above the 1.36 level, then it''s likely that the British pound goes looking to the 1.38 handle.Short-term pullbacks here are possible with the 50 day EMA offering a bit of support near the 1.3433 level.Anything below could open up a drop down to the 200 day EMA, but all things being equal, this is a situation where I think a lot of people are going to be looking at this as a harbinger of U S dollar weakness or strength. This is one of the favorite charts for me daily at the moment.Pound Has Outperformed PreviouslyTop Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewAfter all, even when the U S dollar was so strong during 2024, the British pound fared better than most of its competitors. Just as we''ve seen the same thing on the way back up. If this pair starts to fall apart, I still might not short it, but I probably will short other currencies like the Canadian dollar, the Euro, the Japanese yen, etc.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewAll things being equal though, this is a market that looks like it is trying to get to the upside and eventually break towards 1.38, a trade that I''m very comfortable with, but admittedly have to recognize that this V pattern is pretty aggressive. So, whether or not we can keep up the momentum is a completely different question, but either way, I''m at the very least not shorting this pair anytime soon. I look at it more of an indicator of the US dollar than anything else.Ready to trade the Forex GBP/USD analysis and predictions? Here are the best forex trading platforms UK to choose from.',

The precious metal has now risen in six of the last nine trading sessions. According to data from gold trading platforms, the gold price index rose to the $3370 resistance level before settling around $3355 per ounce at the time of writing. Buying interest in gold increased after US Treasury Secretary Scott Biesent''s comments supporting a half-point interest rate cut in September.Conversely, the latest US Consumer Price Index data showed core inflation rising more than 3% year-on-year. Accordingly, analysts suggest that the US inflation target of 2% is no longer the focus of the Federal Reserve.Upcoming Technical Levels for GoldBased on the daily chart and analyst forecasts, gold''s bullish trend remains supported as long as it holds above the $3300 resistance level. If the current upward momentum continues, the bulls may find opportunities to advance toward resistance levels at $3378, $3385, and then the psychological level of $3400 per ounce, which would strengthen their control over the trend. The recent rally hasn''t significantly moved the 14-day RSI from its midpoint, and the MACD indicator remains in neutral territory.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewAs we mentioned earlier, the $3,400 resistance level will remain an important indicator of bullish control over gold.

    'Weekly Pairs in Focus - August 03 - August 08, 2025 (Charts)',
    'SilverSilver markets spent most of the week selling off, as we have seen a lot of volatility around the world. At this point, it’s worth noting that the US dollar sold off a bit but held firm against certain currencies. In other words, it looks like the volatility is only somewhat justified, and I think at this point in time it’s worth noting that the $36 level seems to be a significant support level just waiting to happen. If we can recapture the $37.50 level, we will probably reenter the range that we had been in during the previous month.GBP/USDThe British pound has plunged for most of the week, testing the crucial 1.32 region. However, we have found a little bit of support at the end of the week as the jobs number in the United States was horrible. This has the US dollar on the back foot just a little bit, but quite frankly, it has held its own fairly well, all things being considered. If we break down below the 50 Week EMA at the 1.3063 region, I suspect that the British pound will start to fall apart. If the British pound falls apart against the US dollar, the greenback probably swallows everything else right along with it.EUR/USDThe euro dropped fairly significantly during the course of the week to peek below the 1.15 level for a while but did recover a bit after the Non-Farm Payroll number came out of the United States much weaker than anticipated. This is an ugly candlestick regardless, so I do think this is a situation where if we get any follow-through whatsoever, namely a breakdown below the bottom of the weekly candlestick from the one that we just printed, the euro could be in serious trouble at that point. On the other hand, if we recapture the 1.16 level, then it’s likely that this pair will look likely to reach the 1.18 level eventually.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewBitcoinBitcoin has had a tough week, but quite frankly Bitcoin had been a little stretched.

    'The Best War Stocks to Buy Now (Chart)',
    'Defense stocks, also referred to as war stocks, are highly popular among professional portfolios, as they can protect the bottom line, staying true to their name. The primary customers of defense stocks are governments, which bring steady, long-term contracts, deep pockets, and a history of paying their bills on time. Pledges by NATO countries to boost defense spending provide a tailwind for earnings in the years ahead. Do you know what to look for in defense stocks?What Are War Stocks?War stocks, also known as defense stocks, refer to publicly listed companies that are actively engaged in the aerospace, space, and defense sectors. They form the backbone of defending sovereign countries and territories. Analysts expect demand to surge over the next decade, with global conflicts and geopolitical tensions rising.Why Should You Consider Investing in Defense Stocks?Defense stocks provide long-term, reliable income streams for companies. They outperform during market corrections and bear markets, as short-term economic cycles have a minimal impact on their business model.Despite popular opinion, conflicts do not move the price of defense stocks. There will be a short-term bounce, which usually falters. Investors must understand the long-term nature of defense stocks, where research and development (R&D) remain crucial. Conflicts boost demand for replenishing stockpiles and hardware, create opportunities to test new weapons platforms, and attract future buyers. Still, R&D and cybersecurity services are where defense stocks receive their best margins.Here are a few things to consider when evaluating defense stocks:The defense sector is seeking green alternatives, and stocks with a lead in sustainability could outperform peersFocus on defense stocks with excellent R&D capabilitiesCommunications, electronic warfare, and cybersecurity defense stocks provide ongoing revenue and have excellent growth ratesDefense stocks active in drone and anti-drone warfare rank among the fast',

    'USD/BRL Analysis Today 13/08: Long-Term Lows (Chart)',
    'The USD/BRL closed within sight of the 5.4000 level yesterday as the currency pair continued to correlate well with the broad Forex market.Yesterday’s close for the USD/BRL was around the 5.4020 level and price action this morning for the currency pair upon opening will prove intriguing for those interested in behavioral sentiment. While Brazil’s ruling government remains locked in a stubborn debate with the U.S White House, financial institutions apparently aren’t all that concerned. The USD/BRL is traversing long-term lows and is trading in a healthy correlation to other major currency pairs.While the USD/BRL traded around the 5.4000 ratio in early July, yesterday’s values however dropped below those early July marks when the 5.3800 level got some attention briefly. There isn’t a great amount of trading volume in the USD/BRL. The currency pair has not demonstrated a serious reversal higher over the past month, showing that financial institutions are comfortable within the lower values for the USD/BRL, spikes higher have been infrequent even with low volumes.Sustained Lows and Speculation in the USD/BRLThe ability of the USD/BRL to sustain lower price action and its trend downwards will prove intriguing to speculators. The USD/BRL doesn’t offer a great amount of price velocity, but traders who have patience and use conservative leverage may have an opportunity to pursue the currency pair with better odds.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewYesterday’s weaker than anticipated CPI year on year number from the U.S helped create more impetus for a weaker USD. The U.S Federal Reserve is now being called upon by analysts to lower the Federal Funds Rate in September, and it is likely the Fed will cut by at least 0.25 basis points. The Fed has been cautious and this has created many critics of its interest rate policy over the past few months.

This did not set up.The small overall loss of 5.60% equals a loss of 0.80% per asset.The news last week was dominated by the US Federal Reserve’s policy meeting, which produced a hawkish tilt. Although the Federal Funds Rate was maintained at 4.50% as was almost universally expected, comments and forecasts made by Jerome Powell and the FOMC sharply reduced expectations of a 0.25% rate cut at the next meeting in September. Stronger than expected Advance GDP data helped fuel this more hawkish narrative, but Friday’s weaker than expected jobs data when Non-Farm Payrolls were released completely reversed the situation and led to stock markets and other risky assets falling sharply. According to the CME’s FedWatch tool, the chance of a 0.25% rate cut in September now stands as high as 80%.The central bank policy meetings in Japan and Canada were of little consequence.There was more volatility than has been usual over recent weeks. The Forex market saw it especially in the Japanese Yen and in the Antipodean currencies (AUD, NZD).Fears of a faltering US economy and a Fed that may have kept interest rates too high for too long will likely translate into risk-off sentiment as this week opens later.A summary of last week’s most important data:US Federal Funds Rate and FOMC Statement – the Federal Funds rate was unchanged,',
