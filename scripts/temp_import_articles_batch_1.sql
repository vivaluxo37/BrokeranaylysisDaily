    'Bitcoin Price 28/05: Stablecoins Steal the Spotlight (Chart)',
    'Bitcoin (BTC) once again led the headlines in the crypto market this week after King Crypto rallied to a new all-time high near $112,000 amid geopolitical de-risking and rising turmoil in the Japanese bond market.Data provided by TradingView shows that after stabilizing near $106,000 last Tuesday, BTC bulls charged on Wednesday to rally above $110,000, then extended their run to the new record high of $112,000 on Thursday.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewMarket watchers attributed the rally to a variety of factors, including President Trump’s announcement of Russia–Ukraine ceasefire talks on May 19, the pause of high tariffs on EU trading partners in the US, and turmoil in bond markets.In the US, the 10-Year Treasury note hit nearly 4.63%, while the US30Y hit 5.153%, its highest level since October 2023. But the real story was in Japan, where the 30-year yield on Japanese bonds reached a new all-time high of 3.185% on May 20, 2025, before retreating to 3.115% on May 23.While government bonds are typically considered safe-haven assets, the recent sharp rise in yields suggests that investor concerns around fiscal sustainability and repayment risk are rising.“Because yields are increasing, sustainability becomes more of an issue, meaning credit risk increases, meaning yields increase even more,” said André Dragosch, Head of European Research at Bitwise. “And so you end up in this kind of fiscal debt doom loop.”He suggested that the increasing volatility in Japan’s bond market may be prompting some institutional investors to reconsider Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against sovereign default risk, noting that “This is now affecting other bond markets, especially the US Treasury market.”With bond market instability rising, highlighting sovereign credit risk concerns, Dragosch underscored Bitcoin’s increasing appeal as an “immutable asset” that is “free of counterparty risk” and serves as “a hedge against sovereign risk and sovereign default.”He added that if things continue on their current track, rising yields could help push Bitcoin towards $200,000, before noting that this remains conditional on continued Bitcoin accumulation by corporations and exchange-traded fund (ETF) holders.For now, that seems likely the case. As noted in last week’s crypto update, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan and noted Bitcoin basher, announced the bank will soon allow its clients to purchase Bitcoin ETFs.But in crypto, nothing is certain. According to analysts at Bitfinex, “The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoinʼs latest breakout was a local high or the prelude to a more aggressive leg higher in Q3.”As for the altcoin market, it was another relatively quiet week as all eyes were on Bitcoin, minus a few breakout tokens. Ether (ETH), for its part, reclaimed a key technical level – the mid-line (~$2,600) of the Gaussian Channel on the 2-week chart – which has historically preceded sharp price gains and marked the start of an “altseason” across multiple market cycles in the last five years.#AltcoinsIt has finally happened.??$ETHhas reclaimed the mid-line in the 2W Gaussian Channel.Each time it managed to do so, strong rallies followed for the entire altcoin market (2021 and 2024 as an example).Altseason isn''t just a meme.. it''s coming ladies & gentlemanpic.twitter.com/jQx1SCXvMo— ???????ⓗ? ? (@el_crypto_prof)May 27, 2025As noted by market analyst Moustache, this development has once again rekindled expectations that an altseason is fast approaching.At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $109,070, and Ether trades at $2,645.Stablecoins Go MainstreamWhile it was largely a week of consolidation for the crypto market, the asset class – particularly stablecoins – stepped into the TradFi limelight as Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, launched an initial public offering (IPO) of 24 million shares of its Class A common stock.Stablecoins have become a hot topic in the realm of payments, and Circle’s IPO launch suggests they will continue to play an expanding role. Thus, it''s not surprising that the IPO launch coincided with the launch of the Circle Payments Network (CPN) Mainnet – a blockchain-powered payments coordination protocol that allows banks and payment providers to exchange payment instructions securely and settle in real time using USDC on public blockchains.Circle Payments Network Mainnet is officially live!Today marks a major milestone for Circle, for@USDC, and for the future of stablecoin powered payments.It started as an idea, but with our first transactions already happening on CPN, it has become a reality.Cross border…pic.twitter.com/hC4ihmIPnN— Circle (@circle)May 21, 2025While the announcement may seem innocuous to some, the stakes are high in the payments space, and the competition is heating up.

    'Forex Today 05/05: Trump Pushes Powell to Cut Rates',
    'President Trump has been publicly stating that the Fed should be cutting rates faster after Friday''s strong jobs data, but the pressure will almost certainly be in vain.Friday saw the release of stronger-than-expected jobs data in the USA, with non-farm payrolls coming in at 117k while only 138k new jobs were expected. Average Hourly Earnings growth was also lower than expected, at 0.2% month-on-month. After the negative Advance GDP print earlier in the week, Trump had a fairly strong case to start calling again for rate cuts, and he reiterated his call a few hours ago while stating that Fed Chair Powell is safe in his role until 2026. Trump has no real power to fire Powell anyway.Stock markets are mixed today, with Asian markets mostly higher, while US equity index futures are trading lower off-hours since markets opened this week in Asia.Bitcoinbriefly broke above the key resistance level at $95,038 but has again fallen back to trade below the big round number at $95,000. We may eventually see a decisive bullish breakout, which could lead to a test of the record price made in December not far from $110,000.The Forex market has seen the New Zealand Dollar as the strongest major currency and the Swiss as the weakest one since today''s Tokyo open, puttingthe NZD/CHF currency crossin focus.The EUR/USD currency pairremains in a long-term bullish trend and most analysts will see it that way as long as the price holds up above the key support level at $1.1241. The US Dollar has lost some ground so far today.There will be releases later today of Swiss CPI and US ISM Services PMI data.It is a public holiday today in the UK, so Forex markets are likely to be quiet until New York opens.',

    'Forex Today: Markets Expect US Inflation Unchanged Today',
    'Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewThe focus will shift today to the release of US CPI (inflation) data, with the annualized rate expected to remain unchanged.Markets will be focusing today on the upcoming release of US CPI (inflation) data. It is widely expected that the annualized rate will remain unchanged at 2.4%, with month-on-month CPI expected to show an increase of 0.3%. If the data is higher than expected, that could boost the USD and sink US stocks; if lower than expected, the opposite will be likely.The big news yesterday was the announcement of a trade deal between the USA and China, who have been engaged in a noisy and destructive trade war since Trump took office in January. It was agreed that during an upcoming 90-day period for further negotiations, the US would drop tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China would drop tariffs on US imports from 125% to 10%. The US Dollar and US stock markets immediately jumped and held these increases, withthe NASDAQ 100 Indexup by 4.4% on the day andthe S&P 500 Indexclosing higher by 3.3%. Asian stock markets have mostly continued this rally, although Chinese indices are trading lower today. This news is likely to be bullish for global risk-on sentiment generally, including stock markets.Following yesterday''s trade deal between the USA and China, markets are now expecting only 2 US rate cuts over the course of 2025, at 0.25% each, according tothe CME FedWatch tool. The first cut is not expected until September.In the Forex market, since today''s Tokyo open, the Australian Dollar has been the strongest major currency, while the USD has been the weakest, puttingthe AUD/USD currency pairin focus - the Aussie typically gains when global risk sentiment improves. However, it can be said that the USD strength we saw yesterday is likely to hold up over the coming days.Bitcoindropped quite sharply yesterday after coming close to testing its record high made a few months ago after making a bullish breakout beyond its former key resistance level at $95,206. This may be partly due to USD strength but can be seen as a sign that Bitcoin bullishness is muted, as other risky assets advanced yesterday on the trade deal news.There will be a release today of UK Claimant Count Change (unemployment claims) data.',

    'Forex Today: Bitcoin Looks to Be Heading to New All-Time',
    'Bitcoin Makes Record High New York Close Yesterday; US Dollar Falls to 2-Week Low, UK CPI Expected to Rise to 3.3%Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewSummary: Bitcoin is rising strongly and Europe opened with Bitcoin less than $2,000 from its record high price.Bitcoin is in focus today after making its highest ever New York close yesterday at about $106,855. The subsequent Asian session saw the major cryptocurrency continue to make gains and as the London session approached, Bitcoin was trading near $107,500. Trend and momentum traders will be interested in being long here. As well as spot Bitcoin, there are also Bitcoin micro futures available, and several Bitcoin ETFs so trading or investing in Bitcoin is very accessible today. It will be interesting to see if Bitcoin breaks its all-time high price not far from $110,000 today.The US Dollar is continuing to weaken, falling to a new 2-week low price. Many analysts see the failure of President Trump''s tax bill in Congress and a perceived push towards a weaker Dollar at the G7 meeting underway in Canada as factors driving the greenback lower.In the Forex market the strongest major currency since the Tokyo open has been the Swiss Franc, while theCanadian Dollarhas been the weakest. However the clearest trend is against the US Dollar and the strongest major currency over a meaningful period of time looks to be the British Pound, so the GBP/USD currency pair will be getting some attention today.There will be a release today ofUK CPI (inflation)data, which is expected to show an increase in the annualized rate from 2.6% to 3.3%.The release of Canadian CPI (inflation) data yesterday fell as expected by 0.1% month on month, but the trimmed and median annualized rates were higher than expected.Start exploring these high-potential assets today and stay ahead of the curve in2025’s dynamic market',

    'Forex Today 11/06: Expect US Inflation to Rise to 2.5%',
    'Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewMarkets are awaiting the release of US CPI data today, which is expected to show an increase in the annualized rate from 2.3% to 2.5%.There will be a key data release today which is usually the most important monthly event in the Forex market: US CPI (inflation) data. This could be decisive for the US Dollar, which is near long-term lows and a key support level. A higher-than-expected number will likely boost the greenback, while a lower than expected number could see it fall, although that would probably boost US stocks.Bitcoinis in focus again after making a new record high at $112,000 only two weeks ago. It went on to make a deep retracement, shaking out many trend traders, but yesterday finally made a notably strong rise, overcoming three key resistance levels. The price has made a natural retracement but is still trading around $110,000 easily within sight of the all-time high at $112,000. If the price closes above that level at the end of the New York session today, a lot of trend traders will get back in with long positions. The best way to invest in Bitcoin over the long-term is either by buying Bitcoin directly, buying a Bitcoin future (micro futures of only 0.1 Bitcoin are available on the CME), or a Bitcoin ETF (there are several, for example BITO).Silverand the precious metalPalladiumare consolidating after making new long-term highs on Monday. Trend traders will be interested in going long here if we see further long-term highs as New York closes today. Palladium futures are expensive, but a Palladium ETF (PALL) is available as a suitable vehicle for many.WTI Crude Oilreached another 2-month high yesterday but then closed lower. It is now rising again.Talks between the US and China concluded yesterday on a positive note, which has been positive for the Chinese stock market.

    'Forex Today 19/06: Cautious Fed, Iran Refusal Weigh on Risk',
    'Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewThe Fed''s refusal to quicken the pace of rate cuts and the growing likelihood of regional war in the Middle East are weighing on global risk sentiment.The US Federal Reserve met last night, announcing that it will maintain its interest rate at the relatively high rate of 4.25%, as was almost unanimously expected by analysts. The most important part of the release and press conference was the emphasis that the Fed is in no hurry to cut its interest rate, despite the risk to the economy which will potentially be caused by President Trump''s new tariffs and resulting retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries. This saw stocks and other risky assets taking a downturn, with the US Dollar and other safe haven assets benefiting.According tothe CME FedWatch tool, markets are still expecting two rate cuts by the Fed before the end of 2025, one in September and one in December, so this is really only a minor development.The war between Iran and Israel enters its seventh day with Israel striking hard at the Iranian nuclear program, including Isfahan and Arak, and continuing to hit regime targets. Yesterday saw President Trump forcefully reject talk of a ceasefire at the same time as three Iranian government planes were allowed by Israel to depart Iran and arrive in Oman. President Trump stated that he demanded nothing less than unconditional surrender by Iran, after which the Iranian nuclear program would be peacefully destroyed. Trump''s bottom line: Iran must not develop a nuclear weapon. Stock markets rose as rumours of an Iranian desire to visit Trump circulated, but Iranian Supreme Leader angrily rejected any talk of "groveling before the White House". Minutes later, the US began organising to evacuate more of its citizens and assets from the region, signaling a potential escalation. On the USA getting involved in attacking Iran, Trump said "I might do it, I might not". Most analysts see the chance of US involvement as rising, with Israeli government officials apparently convinced it is a question of when, not if.The rate of successful Iranian missile fire on Israel had so declined that yesterday the Israeli governent ordered a reopening of workplaces provided they are located near protected areas. About an hour after dawn, Iran fired a relatively large missile barrage targeting a major hospital in Beersheva, a financial target in Ramat Gan, and a residential area near Tel Aviv. There are at least 100 wounded, several seriously. The Israeli government has responded by stating that it will increase its efforts to hit regime targets in Iran, and labelling Khamenei as a war criminal. This is somewhat of an escalation and might further weigh on risk sentiment, as President Trump has been protecting Khameini from being targeted. The price ofWTI Crude Oilis rising, looking bullish near its 4-month high.The Bank of England will be holding a policy meeting today but is not expected to cut its interest rate.The Swiss National Bank will be holding a policy meeting today and is expected to cut its interest rate from 0.25% to 0%.The Forex market is more active this morning. Since the Tokyo open, the strongest major currency has been the New Zealand Dollar, while the weakest has been the Japanese Yen, suggesting a clear risk-off sentiment is dominant.The EUR/USD currency pairis falling quite firmly against its bullish long-term trend. The US Dollar is continuing to strengthen.It is a public holiday in the USA today (Juneteenth).Tomorrow will be a public holiday in New Zealand.',

    'United States GDP Declined 0.5% in Q1 2025',
    'US Final GDP data released on Thursday was a disappointment, with an annualized decrease in the first quarter of 2025 of 0.5%, revised downwards from the second estimate in May of -0.2%. The downward revision was due to decreases in consumer spending, exports and government spending.The first-quarter GDP release marks a sharp reversal from Q4 2024, in which the US economy expanded 2.4% year-on-year, and this is the first time in three years that the US economy has declined.The BEA noted that the current US Dollar GDP, which does not account for the impact of inflation on the current value of GDP, increased by 3.2% year-on-year, lower than the 3.4% gain in the second estimate.The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 3.4% in the first quarter, up from 3.3% in the second estimate. Similarly, the core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy and is closely watched by the Fed, rose 3.7% in Q1, up from 3.6% in the second estimate.Thursday’s weak GDP report is a clear indication that the US economy is slowing down, but the labour market remains surprisingly resilient. Initial jobless claims, released today, dropped to 236,000, down from an upwardly revised 246,000 in the previous release and below the consensus of 245,000. If the US labor market continues to post strong numbers, market expectations for a rate cut in the next few months will increase.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewUS Dollar Loses Ground, Stock Markets Slightly HigherIn the Forex market, the US dollar has retreated against all the major currencies in the aftermath of the GDP and unemployment claims report.

    'Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewThe first trading day of the week saw major US equity indices advance for yet another day to reach new record high prices.Stock markets are continuing to look mostly bullish. Asian markets are mixed, European markets are more bullish, but the US market is the most bullish of all. The bullishness is especially notable in the US tech sector, withthe NASDAQ 100 Indextrading above and theS&P 500trading higher yesterday to make new record highs. The S&P 500 Index just had its best quarter since 2023, increasing in value by more than 10% since April began. Trend and momentum traders will be interested in being long of these indices, and have a choice of CFDs, futures, or ETFs such as SPY and QQQ.The US Dollar Index has continued to fall, reaching a new 3.5-year low on declining rate expectations, as President Trump has publicly fumed about getting a new Fed Chair in place, stating over the weekend that rates should be 1% or 2%, not the 4.25% which they currently stand at. This has increased expectations of rate cuts over 2025 from 2 cuts of 0.25% to 3 cuts one at each remaining Fed meeting.The Forex market is showing increased price movement and volatility, with the declining US Dollar one of the main market drivers right now. Since the Tokyo open, the strongest major currency has been the Japanese Yen, while the weakest has been the Australian Dollar, puttingthe AUD/JPY currency crossin focus.The EUR/USD currency pairhas continued to advance, reaching a new 3.5 year high above $1.1800 earlier, so trend traders will want to be long here - this currency pair has a great record of respecting its long-term trends. The Euro stands out for its long-term strength, especially as it just reached its highest level since 2014 against the Chinese Yuan. We also see the Swiss Franc (CHF) and the British Pound (GBP) reach new multi-year highs against the greenback.Silverremains bullish, although it is still some way off its recent high well above $37.President Trump is threatening Japan with higher tariffs unless it agrees to buy more imported rice from the USA.Later today there will be potentially high-impact data releases in the USA of:JOLTS Job OpeningsISM Manufacturing PMI',

In the wider market, since todays Tokyo open, the Australian Dollar is the strongest major currency, while the Swiss Franc is the weakest.The EUR/USD currency pairremains within a valid long-term bullish trend but yesterday traded as low as $1.1600 so any long trade here does not look very healthy right now.

This seems to be mostly due to optimism that the US will now strike more reasonable trade deals with other nations and trading blocs (for example the EU) after agreeing to impose a relatively low 15% tariff on Japanese auto imports earlier this week. Risk-on sentiment has certainly been boosted. It is notable that it is the broad stock market that is outperforming the tech sector, withthe NASDAQ 100 Indexfailing to approach the S&P 500''s strong performance yesterday.Precious metals remain in focus although they have mostly lost some ground over the past day.

    'RBNZ Leaves Rates Unchanged - 09/07',
    'Today’s rate announcement was significant as it marks the first time that the central bank has failed to lower rates since it started the current easing cycle in August 2024. The RBNZ had lowered rates at six consecutive meetings, chopping 225 basis points during that period. The benchmark rate has remained at its lowest level since August 2022.RBNZ statement: Uncertainty Requires CautionWhy the change in rate policy? The rate statement noted that the “economic outlook remains highly uncertain” and said that the rate path would depend on the following factors – the speed of the economic recovery, inflation and the impact of tariffs.At the same time, the RBNZ signaled that it would continue to loosen monetary policy if inflation continued to ease as the Bank has projected. The Bank released an updated inflation forecast which projected inflation moving towards the top of the Bank’s 1-3% target band in mid-2025 and easing to around 2% by early 2026 due to lower underlying inflation and spare capacity in the economy.The bottom line of the RBNZ rate decision? Today’s hold is likely a short breather rather than a change in monetary policy. The RBNZ signaled at the meeting that it plans to continue trimming rates in order to kick-start the struggling economy, assuming that the economy, and particularly inflation, evolves in line with the RBNZ’s forecasts.The New Zealand economy tipped into a recession last year and lower global demand has hurt the export-dependent economy. The markets expect at least one more rate cut before the end of the year but the rate path will largely depend on inflation and growth data.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewNew Zealand Dollar Steady, Stock Market Dips SharplyThe New Zealand dollar has shown a muted response to today’s rate decision.The NZD/USD currency pairis currently trading at 0.5993, down 0.07% on the day.

    'US and Canadian Inflation Accelerates - 15/07',
    'The markets were braced for a rebound in June inflation in Canada and the US and that’s exactly what happened today in both countries, as CPI and core CPI climbed higher.US CPI, Core CPI Hotter in JuneThe US consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-on year in June, up from 2.4% in May, matching the consensus expectation. This was the second consecutive monthly rise in inflation, which is now at its highest level since February 2025. On a month-on-month basis, CPI rose to 0.3% from 0.1% in May, the largest increase in five months and matching the consensus.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, climbed to 2.9% from 2.8% but below the consensus of 3.0%. Monthly, the core rate rose 0.3%, up from 0.1% in May and matched the consensus.The hotter June inflation numbers were most likely driven by President Trump’s tariffs, which have raised the price on most products imported into the US. The tariffs, which were first imposed in April, did not show a spike in inflation until now and we can expect upcoming that the tariffs will also be felt in upcoming inflation reports as the tariffs continue to filter through the US economy.Today’s hot inflation report means pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower rates will ease. The money markets have priced a hold at the July 30 meeting at close to 100%, although the Fed is expected to resume cutting rates in the fourth quarter.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewCanada’s CPI Hits 1.9%Canada’s inflation rate also heated up in June. CPI rose to 1.9% year-on-year, up from 1.7% in May and in line with the consensus. Inflation remained below the Bank of Canada’s target rate of 2% for a third successive month. Monthly, CPI dropped to 0.1%, compared to 0.6% in May and matching the consensus expectation. The trimmed-mean core CPI, which the BoC uses as its preferred gauge for underlying inflation, was unchanged at 3% y/y, as expected. BoC policymakers won’t be losing any sleep over headline CPI, which remains below the 2% target, but would like to see core CPI ease before delivering a rate cut.US Dollar Shows Muted Reaction, US Stock Market Edges Higher After Inflation ReportThe US dollar is showing limited in the aftermath of today’s inflation report.

    'US Inflation Unchanged but Core CPI Accelerates',
    'The US consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-on-year in July, unchanged from the June figure and below the market estimate of 2.8%. CPI remained at its lowest annual inflation rate since February 2021. Monthly CPI eased, rising to 0.2% from 0.3%, in line with market expectations. Gasoline and fuel oil prices continued to decline sharply, a key factor in easing inflation.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, moved in the opposite direction. Annual CPI climbed to 3.1% in July, up from 2.9% and above the market estimate of 3.0%. This marked the highest level in five months. Monthly, the core rate rose 0.3%, up from 0.2% and in line with the market estimate.The rise in core CPI reflects the effect of Trump''s tariffs, which took effect in April and continue to filter through the economy. The tariffs are expected to dampen growth and raise inflation, as US consumers pay more for imported goods.Inflation Report Likely Cements Rate Cut in SeptemberThe Federal Reserve has been on an extended pause and hasn''t lowered interest rates since December 2024. That is expected to change at the next Fed meeting, barring an extreme surprise. The markets have currently priced in a 94% likelihood of a rate cut at the Sep. 17 meeting, up sharply from 84% just before the inflation release.

    'Published articles: 25456About Christopher LewisChristopher Lewis is a Columbus, OH-based Forex trader who enjoys trading a wide range of pairs from the traditional EUR/USD to more exotic USD/RUB, and many things in between. Unlike many Forex traders who prefer to trade in a specific market session, Christopher takes advantage of the flexibility provided by the currency markets, and he trades in all sessions, most often when he’s taking a study break from pursuing degrees in both finance and computer science.Mr. Lewis most often trades on the daily or weekly chart, rather than on a shorter time frame, making his market outlooks suitable for traders in all time zones. In addition to multiple daily analyses, he has been providing Broker Analysis.com traders with regular video analyses for several years. He also contributes weekly Forex forecasts, monthly outlooks and even yearly forecasts, all of which are all highly valued by his loyal following. Christopher has tested dozens of Forex trading platforms during his years as a trader, though he now uses GFT’s 360 DealBook when placing personal trades.In late 2014 Mr. Lewis began contributing signals to ForexSignalz.com, where he collaborates with Broker Analysis’s chief trader, Adam Lemon, to provide additional signals to serious traders directly to their mobile phones. Mr. Lewis’s signals, although not overly aggressive, are largely based upon his own personal trades and trading strategies that he has cultivated over many years, making them suitable for traders at all levels and for traders using a range of trading platforms.When he’s not studying, trading or chasing after his two young children, Christopher manages to find time to operate his own Forex website, aptly called The Trader Guy.

I trade the major Forex pairs, some Futures contracts, and I rely entirely on Technical Analysis to place my trades. Today, I am also a Senior Analyst for Broker Analysis.com.I began trading the markets in the early 1990s, at the age of sixteen. I had a few hundred British pounds saved up (I grew up in England), with which I was able to open a small account with some help from my Dad. I started my trading journey by buying UK equities that I had read about in the business sections of newspapers. The 1990s were a bull market, so naturally, I made money.I was fortunate enough in my early twenties to have a friend that recommended a Technical Analysis course run by a British trader who emphasized raw chart analysis without indicators. Having this first-principles approach to charts influences how I trade to this day.My first trade based on a purely Technical view (i.e. without considering any fundamental analysis) was in early 2001 when the UK equity index, FTSE, broke a long-term support level. Many economists believed the market would continue rising, but the chart painted a different picture. After the support level broke (and the same level was subsequently tested as a resistance), I shorted the FTSE futures contract and watched the market fall. It was a fantastic validation of my understanding of Technical Analysis principles, and I loved that I could profit against the majority view of the market.Fast forward some years, and after acquiring a few grey hairs, I’ve spent a career in consulting (non-market related) paralleled with trading (over that time, I have traded full-time for more than seven years).I’ve met some great people along the way and was lucky enough to deliver presentations at the Las Vegas and Toronto MoneyShow events on behalf of Broker Analysis.Today, I trade seven major Forex pairs and some futures contracts, including the S&P 500, Russel, Natural Gas and Crude Oil.The one p',

It is a purely technical strategy depending entirely upon technical analysis of historical time series price data.The basic idea is that assets whose price has been going up are worth buying, on the belief that the price will continue to rise, while assets whose price has been going down are worth selling on the belief that the price will continue to fall.Momentum trading is a continuation strategy, not a reversal strategy.Momentum traders will decide upon a “universe” of tradable assets, and the criteria for determining when any of them are exhibiting strong enough momentum suitable for a trade entry.Momentum Trading Strategies - TypesThere are basically two types of momentum trading strategies:“Best of” Momentum Trading StrategiesHere, the trader monitors their universe of assets, and will look to go long of the asset or assets which are showing the strongest bullish momentum, and short of the asset or assets which are showing the strongest bearish momentum.For example, let’s suppose that a momentum trader builds a universe of the following tradable assets:This momentum trader uses a “best of” momentum strategy where at the start of each yearly quarter, he or she measures the performances of these assets over the previous quarter, and for the followin',

    'Do I Pay Tax on Forex Trading in the UK? Forex Tax HMRC',
    'I mistakenly did not think about taxes at the beginning of my trading career in the UK. This led to some preventable errors, and I want to help others avoid the same mistakes. In this article, I will give a comprehensive overview, presenting all the key information in one place, covering:whether all forex traders pay taxes in the UKUK tax classification according to the HMRCincome tax, corporation tax, and capital gain taxstrategies to reduce taxable incomea forex trading tax exampledetermining tax statusreporting and filing requirementsLet’s begin.Understanding Forex Trading Taxes in the UKLike all countries, the UK has tax rules that its residents should follow religiously. The UK’s tax-collecting authority, HM Revenues and Customs (HMRC) does not take kindly to people not paying their taxes. It seeks to recover unpaid taxes, impose fines, and sometimes pursue criminal proceedings. That is not a road anyone would wish to travel down.Do All Forex Traders Pay Taxes in the UK?I get asked this question most often, so let’s address it now. There are several scenarios where traders do not pay taxes on their trading profits:Everyone can make up to £1000 annually in trading profits without paying taxesSpread betting, as opposed to Contracts for Difference (CFDs), is tax-free so long as the HMRC does not view your trading as your profession (i.e. for example, trading regularly and making most of your income from it). The tax-free status of spread betting is mainly why people are drawn to it compared to CFDs.Individuals have a capital gains tax allowance (the Annual Exempt Amount) each tax year, allowing them to pay no tax on capital gains up to this level. The Annual Exempt Amount for the 2024/25 tax year is £3,000.UK Tax Classification According to the HMRCThree tax categories can apply to traders: Capital Gains, Income, and Corporation Tax.Capital Gains Tax (CGT)This is the most common tax CFD and Forex traders pay. Remember, Capital Gains Tax does not apply to spread be',

    'A Long-Term Ripple Price Prediction for 2021, 2025, and 2030',
    'Ripple Labs initiated its business in 2012 under the name of Opencoin. XRP has been traded with solid volume since it started to make formal agreements with financial institutions. Ripple Labs started with the promise of providing its users a revolutionary payment protocols system for banking transactions with quicker times to settle the transfer of funds at cheaper costs.The value of XRP/USD has been very volatile since 2017. My Ripple price prediction for 2025 sees the coin trading between $1.15 and $8. By the year 2030 Ripple could be valued between $6 and $15. These forecasts are based on market sentiment and the utilitarian capabilities of Ripple via its XRP coin.The XRP/USD coin’s primary use is making the clearing of funds easier for financial institutions and businesses associated with them. XRP/USD not a ''standard'' cryptocurrency like many of its major counterparts, the distributed ledger from Ripple is internal. Ripple Labs coding is ‘open source’, but XRP/USD uses a centralized system in which Ripple controls the allocation of the XRT coins, sometimes to the dismay of its skeptics.The fact that XRP/USD is centralized has become not only a ‘concern’ for many cryptocurrency influencers, but has also created a legal argument with the SEC. The Security Exchange Commission has in essence declared they believe the XRT coin is a ‘secured asset’, which would mean it has legal oversight domain. An official lawsuit was initiated by the SEC in December of 2020 against Ripple Labs and some of its executives. A contested fight within the U.S court system is anticipated.Is Ripple Undervalued?Ripple''s XRP coin does not have an unlimited supply. The initial minting of XRP coins was said to be 100 billion. The current price of XRP/USD is near $0.67 cents. In early April 2021, XRP/USD was trading within sight of $2.00 as the broad cryptocurrency market enjoyed a heightened state of exuberance.The fall to its current price level has XRP/USD testing important support values',

    'A Long-Term Litecoin Price Prediction for 2025',
    'Litecoin HistoryLitecoin entered the world of cryptocurrency with a rather impressive start when digital assets began to find favor with speculators and investors throughout the globe. There was a time when LTC/USD was rated within the top 5 of cryptocurrency market capitalizations as its proponents argued positively regarding its merits compared to the likes of Bitcoin. This caused a groundswell of support as people asked what the price of Litecoin would be several years in the future.Litecoin was essentially created in 2011. However the digital asset began trading in earnest with wide market interest in 2017 like many of its major counterparts, when cryptocurrencies jumped into the spotlight as their speculative gains caught the attention of the financial media. Like the other major cryptocurrencies, LTC/USD essentially went from a speculative asset few had ever heard of in early 2017 with a value of little more than nothing, to a digital asset that achieved a high price above $400 per coin in December that same calendar year. However, Litecoin then suffered a large fall in value over the coming year in line with the broader cryptocurrency market.Litecoin compared to Bitcoin was held up as a faster cryptocurrency regarding the ability to ‘mine’ its blockchain, and its transactional ability was also hailed as faster than Bitcoin, and these elements remain true to this day for the decentralized digital asset. However, not everything has been wine and roses for Litecoin early adapters, speculators and investors. Litecoin, like all cryptocurrencies, has enjoyed days of highs and extreme lows as technical and market behaviors have frequently caused storms.At the time of writing in August 2021, LTC/USD has gone through the whirlwind of its spring 2021 surge and slump like most of the major cryptocurrencies. The month of August certainly produced a rather nice climb for Litecoin, but prior to this bullish trend, LTC/USD suffered steep losses and saw lows just above $100',

    'Australia vs IC Markets: What Does It Mean? [year, month]',
    'Australian billionaire Andrew Budzinski, 49, founded the renowned Australian CFD and Forex broker IC Markets. He was 2024’s 65th wealthiest Australian, with a net worth of A$2.71 billion, and faces two separate lawsuits that could cost him hundreds of millions of dollars if he is found liable.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe secretive, little-known billionaire and IC Markets face a class action lawsuit for pocketing A$1+ billion in profits and dividends on the back of heavy losses by the broker’s retail traders. An additional lawsuit charges Budzinski with violating Fair Work policies by berating staff using homophobic slurs, threatening to withhold salaries, and sacking the entire Australian office. The question is, do the lawsuits hold merit, and what might the outcomes mean for the Australian and global retail trading industries?The second lawsuit, about Fair Work violations, targets the character of Budzinski in allegations made by a former disgruntled employee targeting Finohelp Support Pty Ltd., a support services company that assisted IC Markets with payroll. So, I will not dive into what may or may not have occurred, as it has no direct impact on CFD and Forex traders in Australia. The class action lawsuits should concern Australian-resident traders, however, as they could open the gates for more counter-productive regulatory changes, pushing Australia further behind competitive alternatives.What Should You Know Before We Look at The Allegations?Between 70% and 90% of retail traders lose money, which has less to do with leverage maximums and more to do with a lack of market education, discipline, and knowledge. Regulators cannot force traders to acquire the necessary knowledge to trade more profitably, or to use proper risk management, or comprehend the relationship between risk management, position sizing, and leverage. So, they lower the maximum leverage as a blunt regulatory tool. This gives the illusion',

    'Base Currency Definition: What Investors Should Know',
    'Currency pairings are used to estimate currency unit prices in the forex market. The base currency (also known as transaction currency) is the initial currency mentioned in a currency pair quote, succeeded by the quote currency (also known as the counter currency). A financial firm can use the base currency as the accounting currency or domestic currency to reflect all profits or losses for financial reporting reasons.Base Currency Definition in ForexIn the Forex market, the base currency is the first of two currencies seen in a currency pair quote. After the base currency, the quotation mentions the counter currency. Let’s find out more about base currency and what it means in Forex.AdvertisementTake advantage of today''s market opportunitiesSTART TRADING NOWUnderstanding base currencyThe base currency in a currency pair, such as USD/GBP, is the first currency specified (where the USD is the base currency). The quotation, also known as the counter currency, is the second currency. We generally expect the base currency to increase in respect of the quote/counter currency whether you "long" the currency pair. You would predict the reverse if you were "short" on the pair.What Are Examples of Base Currency?The euro versus the US dollar, generally known as EUR/USD, is the most frequently traded currency pair. Here''s an illustration of how to understand currency pairs:It''s 2024, and John is planning a trip to California. He lives in England and only carries pounds sterling. As a result, he goes to a forex agency to convert his GBP to USD. The rate is USD/GBP = 1.4, according to the Forex executive. This implies that $1 is worth 1.4 GBP.In my case, the quote currency is GBP, and the base currency is USD. As a result, John can swap 1.4 GBP for USD 1 at the Forex market.There are numerous distinct currency pairs around the world, and they are classified according to the frequency and magnitude of their dealings.

    'Blockchain in Forex Trading – All You Need to Know!',
    'Forex trading is the latest market that blockchain technology is disrupting in 2025.The Forex market, which is operational 24/7, and blockchain, which provides the technological basis for cryptocurrency trading, are ideal for integration. Blockchain offers transparent, secure, fast, and cost-effective transaction methods. For this reason, the technology holds incredible promise for the Forex industry, although certain challenges need to be overcome. In this article, we''ll dig deep into how blockchain has the potential to transform Forex trading, the pros and cons for the industry, and how this technology can be leveraged.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow Blockchain WorksA blockchain is a ledger (a digital record of transactions) that executes secure transactions in a peer-to-peer network. It processes, stores, verifies, and records data automatically on the network, usually with a decentralized system. So, for two people to transact, there''s no need for an intermediary such as a bank or payment processor.When a blockchain is decentralized, this means that no single entity has complete control. It can be governed communally, by hundreds, if not thousands, of network nodes. As a result, it is incredibly secure, as there''s no single point of failure. That means that data cannot be modified or deleted without a network consensus.The primary use case for blockchain technology is that it allows people to transact cryptocurrencies, although blockchains can now integrate other types of data and use smart contracts. This enables the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can take real-world assets such as property and data onto the blockchain. So, when it comes to Forex trading, traditional fiat currency can be merged with blockchain technology to increase trade efficiency.Public vs Private BlockchainsThere are two distinct types of blockchains:Public blockchains are decentralized and open, so anyone can participate a',

    'Crypto vs Stocks -Similarities & Differences & Trading Risks',
    'Intro to Trading StocksTop Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHere are ten essential takeaways for trading stocks:Buying a stock means buying a piece of a company. That’s why stocks are also called shares: owning a stock is owning a “share” of a company. If I buy one Apple share, it literally means I own a (tiny) piece of the company Apple.Companies issue stocks to raise capital to finance their business. When a company issues stocks for the first time, it is called an “Initial Public Offering” (IPO).A stock exchange is a centralized body that “lists” companies’ shares for brokers to buy and sell on behalf of their clients. The largest stock exchange in the world is the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE), with over two thousand different companies’ stocks. Stock exchanges are highly regulated to protect investors and companies participating in them.Some companies pay dividends, which are direct payments from their profits to the stock''s owners. I remember my dad getting physical dividend checks from companies whose stocks he owned!Some trading instruments allow trading the price of a stock without physically buying and selling it. For example, CFDs and futures contracts can mirror the stock price but do not involve holding the stock itself. The advantage is trading on leverage and taking short positions, both of which are not always possible when trading the stock directly. The best stock brokers offer a wide selection of individual stocks for trading at competitive fees, overseen by sufficient regulation.Options contracts (i.e., “call” and “put” options) are also a popular method of trading stocks. They allow traders to access leverage, take short positions, and find unique ways to profit from stock price movements. For example, some option strategies allow traders to profit if a stock price stays in a specified range.The primary measure of a stock’s fundamental value is its price-earnings ratio or “PE.” This is the stock’s pr',
