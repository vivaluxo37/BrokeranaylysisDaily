Unlike many Forex traders who prefer to trade in a specific market session, Christopher takes advantage of the flexibility provided by the currency markets, and he trades in all sessions, most often when he’s taking a study break from pursuing degrees in both finance and computer science.Mr. Lewis most often trades on the daily or weekly chart, rather than on a shorter time frame, making his market outlooks suitable for traders in all time zones. In addition to multiple daily analyses, he has been providing Broker Analysis.com traders with regular video analyses for several years. He also contributes weekly Forex forecasts, monthly outlooks and even yearly forecasts, all of which are all highly valued by his loyal following. Christopher has tested dozens of Forex trading platforms during his years as a trader, though he now uses GFT’s 360 DealBook when placing personal trades.In late 2014 Mr. Lewis began contributing signals to ForexSignalz.com, where he collaborates with Broker Analysis’s chief trader, Adam Lemon, to provide additional signals to serious traders directly to their mobile phones. Mr. Lewis’s signals, although not overly aggressive, are largely based upon his own personal trades and trading strategies that he has cultivated over many years, making them suitable for traders at all levels and for traders using a range of trading platforms.When he’s not studying, trading or chasing after his two young children, Christopher manages to find time to operate his own Forex website, aptly called The Trader Guy.

I trade the major Forex pairs, some Futures contracts, and I rely entirely on Technical Analysis to place my trades. Today, I am also a Senior Analyst for Broker Analysis.com.I began trading the markets in the early 1990s, at the age of sixteen. I had a few hundred British pounds saved up (I grew up in England), with which I was able to open a small account with some help from my Dad. I started my trading journey by buying UK equities that I had read about in the business sections of newspapers. The 1990s were a bull market, so naturally, I made money.I was fortunate enough in my early twenties to have a friend that recommended a Technical Analysis course run by a British trader who emphasized raw chart analysis without indicators. Having this first-principles approach to charts influences how I trade to this day.My first trade based on a purely Technical view (i.e. without considering any fundamental analysis) was in early 2001 when the UK equity index, FTSE, broke a long-term support level. Many economists believed the market would continue rising, but the chart painted a different picture. After the support level broke (and the same level was subsequently tested as a resistance), I shorted the FTSE futures contract and watched the market fall. It was a fantastic validation of my understanding of Technical Analysis principles, and I loved that I could profit against the majority view of the market.Fast forward some years, and after acquiring a few grey hairs, I’ve spent a career in consulting (non-market related) paralleled with trading (over that time, I have traded full-time for more than seven years).I’ve met some great people along the way and was lucky enough to deliver presentations at the Las Vegas and Toronto MoneyShow events on behalf of Broker Analysis.Today, I trade seven major Forex pairs and some futures contracts, including the S&P 500, Russel, Natural Gas and Crude Oil.The one p', 'I’m a trader and manage my own capital.
