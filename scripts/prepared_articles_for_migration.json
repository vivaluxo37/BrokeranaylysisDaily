Source: TradingViewThe pause in crypto prices comes as concerns around Trump’s trade war and tariffs have begun to subside. Many now realize that the early numbers were designed to get trading partners to the negotiating table, which has worked for most countries except for China.While prices have stagnated, behind the scenes, speculative capital is entering the market at a feverish pace, with onchain analytics firm Glassnode reporting a surge in Bitcoin’s so-called “hot capital.”#Bitcoin's Hot Capital (sum of coins moved in the last 24h + 1d–1w) reached $39.1B on 28 Apr - its highest since 10 Feb. This metric captures short-term holder activity and is a proxy for speculative capital entering the market:https://t.co/gxCGzWzEHWpic.twitter.com/hephgPEzTx— glassnode (@glassnode)April 29, 2025As shown in the X post above, Glassnode data indicates that the sum of tokens moving over the past week hit the highest level since early February, surging by more than 90% to almost $40 billion.“Since 21 Apr, $BTC hot capital rose from $20.7B to $39.1B - an increase of $18.7B or +92%,” Glassnode said in afollow-up post. “This is one of the fastest upticks in short-term realized cap in recent months, signaling a surge in active capital turnover.”Glassnodeaddedthat BTC hot capital hit a low of $17.5B on March 23, its lowest level since December, and over the past five weeks, it has added more than $21.5B, “suggesting a rapid shift from dormancy to speculation among newer market entrants.However, despite the surge in hot capital, Glassnode says it's too early to declare the return of a full-blown bull market, as overall network participation remains low.“Signs of early FOMO are emerging, with the Hot Capital Share ticking higher and profitability metrics like Percent Supply in Profit (86%) and NUPL (0.53) expanding notably,” the firm wrote in its latestMarket Pulse analysis. “However, while on-chain activity such as transfer volume and fees are recovering, daily active addresses remain suppressed, suggesting that full organic network engagement is still rebuilding.”The report showed that futures open interest is rising, but funding rates have flipped to negative, a signal that short sellers have entered the market.“This combination of elevated leverage, aggressive short positioning, and persistent taker demand creates a fragile but explosive setup,” Glassnode said. “Should the rally sustain, short squeezes could drive a volatile extension higher; conversely, if momentum stalls, the market could see amplified swings as both sides unwind.”The report concluded by noting that while spot demand and ETF participation are materially improving, “the growing signs of FOMO and leveraged imbalance in futures suggest that volatility risks remain elevated in the short term.”At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $94,990, an increase of 1.62% on the 7-day chart.Monero Surge Linked to Bitcoin TheftMonero (XMR), a leading privacy token, was one of the top performers over the past week, spiking 43.5% on Sunday and into Monday.XMR/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe sudden surge excited privacy fans, but their enthusiasm has since been tempered by onchain sleuth ZachXBT, who said the pump was likely due to a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin, valued at $330.7 million, that may indicate a significant theft.Nine hours ago a suspicious transfer was made from a potential victim for 3520 BTC ($330.7M)Theft addressbc1qcrypchnrdx87jnal5e5m849fw460t4gk7vz55gShortly after the funds began to be laundered via 6+ instant exchanges and was swapped for XMR causing the XMR price to spike…— ZachXBT (@zachxbt)April 28, 2025ZachXBT noted that once the transfer was confirmed, the stolen stash was quickly distributed to six instant exchanges for laundering, ultimately being swapped into Monero.

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) once again led the headlines in the crypto market this week after King Crypto rallied to a new all-time high near $112,000 amid geopolitical de-risking and rising turmoil in the Japanese bond market.Data provided by TradingView shows that after stabilizing near $106,000 last Tuesday, BTC bulls charged on Wednesday to rally above $110,000, then extended their run to the new record high of $112,000 on Thursday.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewMarket watchers attributed the rally to a variety of factors, including President Trump’s announcement of Russia–Ukraine ceasefire talks on May 19, the pause of high tariffs on EU trading partners in the US, and turmoil in bond markets.In the US, the 10-Year Treasury note hit nearly 4.63%, while the US30Y hit 5.153%, its highest level since October 2023. But the real story was in Japan, where the 30-year yield on Japanese bonds reached a new all-time high of 3.185% on May 20, 2025, before retreating to 3.115% on May 23.While government bonds are typically considered safe-haven assets, the recent sharp rise in yields suggests that investor concerns around fiscal sustainability and repayment risk are rising.“Because yields are increasing, sustainability becomes more of an issue, meaning credit risk increases, meaning yields increase even more,” said André Dragosch, Head of European Research at Bitwise. “And so you end up in this kind of fiscal debt doom loop.”He suggested that the increasing volatility in Japan’s bond market may be prompting some institutional investors to reconsider Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against sovereign default risk, noting that “This is now affecting other bond markets, especially the US Treasury market.”With bond market instability rising, highlighting sovereign credit risk concerns, Dragosch underscored Bitcoin’s increasing appeal as an “immutable asset” that is “free of counterparty risk” and serves as “a hedge against sovereign risk and sovereign default.”He added that if things continue on their current track, rising yields could help push Bitcoin towards $200,000, before noting that this remains conditional on continued Bitcoin accumulation by corporations and exchange-traded fund (ETF) holders.For now, that seems likely the case. As noted in last week’s crypto update, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan and noted Bitcoin basher, announced the bank will soon allow its clients to purchase Bitcoin ETFs.But in crypto, nothing is certain. According to analysts at Bitfinex, “The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoinʼs latest breakout was a local high or the prelude to a more aggressive leg higher in Q3.”As for the altcoin market, it was another relatively quiet week as all eyes were on Bitcoin, minus a few breakout tokens. Ether (ETH), for its part, reclaimed a key technical level – the mid-line (~$2,600) of the Gaussian Channel on the 2-week chart – which has historically preceded sharp price gains and marked the start of an “altseason” across multiple market cycles in the last five years.#AltcoinsIt has finally happened.??$ETHhas reclaimed the mid-line in the 2W Gaussian Channel.Each time it managed to do so, strong rallies followed for the entire altcoin market (2021 and 2024 as an example).Altseason isn't just a meme.. it's coming ladies & gentlemanpic.twitter.com/jQx1SCXvMo— ???????ⓗ? ? (@el_crypto_prof)May 27, 2025As noted by market analyst Moustache, this development has once again rekindled expectations that an altseason is fast approaching.At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $109,070, and Ether trades at $2,645.Stablecoins Go MainstreamWhile it was largely a week of consolidation for the crypto market, the asset class – particularly stablecoins – stepped into the TradFi limelight as Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, launched an initial public offering (IPO) of 24 million shares of its Class A common stock.Stablecoins have become a hot topic in the realm of payments, and Circle’s IPO launch suggests they will continue to play an expanding role. Thus, it's not surprising that the IPO launch coincided with the launch of the Circle Payments Network (CPN) Mainnet – a blockchain-powered payments coordination protocol that allows banks and payment providers to exchange payment instructions securely and settle in real time using USDC on public blockchains.Circle Payments Network Mainnet is officially live!Today marks a major milestone for Circle, for@USDC, and for the future of stablecoin powered payments.It started as an idea, but with our first transactions already happening on CPN, it has become a reality.Cross border…pic.twitter.com/hC4ihmIPnN— Circle (@circle)May 21, 2025While the announcement may seem innocuous to some, the stakes are high in the payments space, and the competition is heating up.

    "content": "President Trump has been publicly stating that the Fed should be cutting rates faster after Friday's strong jobs data, but the pressure will almost certainly be in vain.Friday saw the release of stronger-than-expected jobs data in the USA, with non-farm payrolls coming in at 117k while only 138k new jobs were expected. Average Hourly Earnings growth was also lower than expected, at 0.2% month-on-month. After the negative Advance GDP print earlier in the week, Trump had a fairly strong case to start calling again for rate cuts, and he reiterated his call a few hours ago while stating that Fed Chair Powell is safe in his role until 2026. Trump has no real power to fire Powell anyway.Stock markets are mixed today, with Asian markets mostly higher, while US equity index futures are trading lower off-hours since markets opened this week in Asia.Bitcoinbriefly broke above the key resistance level at $95,038 but has again fallen back to trade below the big round number at $95,000.

The US Dollar has lost some ground so far today.There will be releases later today of Swiss CPI and US ISM Services PMI data.It is a public holiday today in the UK, so Forex markets are likely to be quiet until New York opens.",

It is widely expected that the annualized rate will remain unchanged at 2.4%, with month-on-month CPI expected to show an increase of 0.3%. If the data is higher than expected, that could boost the USD and sink US stocks; if lower than expected, the opposite will be likely.The big news yesterday was the announcement of a trade deal between the USA and China, who have been engaged in a noisy and destructive trade war since Trump took office in January. It was agreed that during an upcoming 90-day period for further negotiations, the US would drop tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China would drop tariffs on US imports from 125% to 10%. The US Dollar and US stock markets immediately jumped and held these increases, withthe NASDAQ 100 Indexup by 4.4% on the day andthe S&P 500 Indexclosing higher by 3.3%. Asian stock markets have mostly continued this rally, although Chinese indices are trading lower today. This news is likely to be bullish for global risk-on sentiment generally, including stock markets.Following yesterday's trade deal between the USA and China, markets are now expecting only 2 US rate cuts over the course of 2025, at 0.25% each, according tothe CME FedWatch tool. The first cut is not expected until September.In the Forex market, since today's Tokyo open, the Australian Dollar has been the strongest major currency, while the USD has been the weakest, puttingthe AUD/USD currency pairin focus - the Aussie typically gains when global risk sentiment improves. However, it can be said that the USD strength we saw yesterday is likely to hold up over the coming days.Bitcoindropped quite sharply yesterday after coming close to testing its record high made a few months ago after making a bullish breakout beyond its former key resistance level at $95,206.

It will be interesting to see if Bitcoin breaks its all-time high price not far from $110,000 today.The US Dollar is continuing to weaken, falling to a new 2-week low price. Many analysts see the failure of President Trump's tax bill in Congress and a perceived push towards a weaker Dollar at the G7 meeting underway in Canada as factors driving the greenback lower.In the Forex market the strongest major currency since the Tokyo open has been the Swiss Franc, while theCanadian Dollarhas been the weakest. However the clearest trend is against the US Dollar and the strongest major currency over a meaningful period of time looks to be the British Pound, so the GBP/USD currency pair will be getting some attention today.There will be a release today ofUK CPI (inflation)data, which is expected to show an increase in the annualized rate from 2.6% to 3.3%.The release of Canadian CPI (inflation) data yesterday fell as expected by 0.1% month on month, but the trimmed and median annualized rates were higher than expected.Start exploring these high-potential assets today and stay ahead of the curve in2025’s dynamic market",

This could be decisive for the US Dollar, which is near long-term lows and a key support level.

It went on to make a deep retracement, shaking out many trend traders, but yesterday finally made a notably strong rise, overcoming three key resistance levels. The price has made a natural retracement but is still trading around $110,000 easily within sight of the all-time high at $112,000. If the price closes above that level at the end of the New York session today, a lot of trend traders will get back in with long positions.

    "content": "Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewThe Fed's refusal to quicken the pace of rate cuts and the growing likelihood of regional war in the Middle East are weighing on global risk sentiment.The US Federal Reserve met last night, announcing that it will maintain its interest rate at the relatively high rate of 4.25%, as was almost unanimously expected by analysts. The most important part of the release and press conference was the emphasis that the Fed is in no hurry to cut its interest rate, despite the risk to the economy which will potentially be caused by President Trump's new tariffs and resulting retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries. This saw stocks and other risky assets taking a downturn, with the US Dollar and other safe haven assets benefiting.According tothe CME FedWatch tool, markets are still expecting two rate cuts by the Fed before the end of 2025, one in September and one in December, so this is really only a minor development.The war between Iran and Israel enters its seventh day with Israel striking hard at the Iranian nuclear program, including Isfahan and Arak, and continuing to hit regime targets. Yesterday saw President Trump forcefully reject talk of a ceasefire at the same time as three Iranian government planes were allowed by Israel to depart Iran and arrive in Oman. President Trump stated that he demanded nothing less than unconditional surrender by Iran, after which the Iranian nuclear program would be peacefully destroyed. Trump's bottom line: Iran must not develop a nuclear weapon. Stock markets rose as rumours of an Iranian desire to visit Trump circulated, but Iranian Supreme Leader angrily rejected any talk of \"groveling before the White House\". Minutes later, the US began organising to evacuate more of its citizens and assets from the region, signaling a potential escalation. On the USA getting involved in attacking Iran, Trump said \"I might do it, I might not\". Most analysts see the chance of US involvement as rising, with Israeli government officials apparently convinced it is a question of when, not if.The rate of successful Iranian missile fire on Israel had so declined that yesterday the Israeli governent ordered a reopening of workplaces provided they are located near protected areas. About an hour after dawn, Iran fired a relatively large missile barrage targeting a major hospital in Beersheva, a financial target in Ramat Gan, and a residential area near Tel Aviv. There are at least 100 wounded, several seriously. The Israeli government has responded by stating that it will increase its efforts to hit regime targets in Iran, and labelling Khamenei as a war criminal. This is somewhat of an escalation and might further weigh on risk sentiment, as President Trump has been protecting Khameini from being targeted. The price ofWTI Crude Oilis rising, looking bullish near its 4-month high.The Bank of England will be holding a policy meeting today but is not expected to cut its interest rate.The Swiss National Bank will be holding a policy meeting today and is expected to cut its interest rate from 0.25% to 0%.The Forex market is more active this morning. Since the Tokyo open, the strongest major currency has been the New Zealand Dollar, while the weakest has been the Japanese Yen, suggesting a clear risk-off sentiment is dominant.The EUR/USD currency pairis falling quite firmly against its bullish long-term trend. The US Dollar is continuing to strengthen.It is a public holiday in the USA today (Juneteenth).Tomorrow will be a public holiday in New Zealand.",

    "content": "The United States Federal Reserve maintained the benchmark rate at a range between 4.25% and 4.5% at Wednesday’s meeting. This comes after the Fed held rates at this level at its prior meetings in January, March and May, after cutting rates at the final three meetings in 2024. Today’s decision, which was a unanimous vote, was widely expected. The US dollar has showed little response to the Fed decision.FOMC Statement Dovish, Notes Concern about Inflation, US EconomyThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement noted that, “the unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated”. The statement added that concern about the economic outlook “has diminished but remains elevated”.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the message of the FOMC statement at his press conference, saying that “despite elevated uncertainty, the economy is in a solid position. Powell said that the labor market was in good shape and inflation had dropped significantly but was still above the 2% target.Powell: Tariffs Starting to Affect InflationPowell also discussed the US tariffs, saying that although recent inflation readings had been “favorable”, the Fed was “beginning to see some effects” of tariffs on inflation and that he expected upcoming inflation reports to reflect higher inflation as the tariffs continued to filter through the economy.US President Trump has been highly critical of Powell for not lowering interest rates but Powell has stuck to his guns. Powell again defended his position on Wednesday, saying that the Fed’s current stance leaves it “well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.”The Fed also released its “dot plot”, a chart of where each FOMC member thinks interest rates are headed. The dot plot showed members expect two interest rates in 2025 and one more cut in 2026 and 2027.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewUS Dollar, Stock Markets Shrug after Fed AnnouncementThe US dollar showed little reaction to the Fed decision. USD/JPY, EUR/USD and GBP/USD are showing limited movement on Thursday. The exception has been AUD/USD, which is down 0.49%, and NZD/USD , which has declined 0.75%. These declines are likely due to a soft Australian employment report on Thursday. US stock markets showed virtually no reaction in the aftermath of the Fed decision. The S&P 500 Index declined 1.85 points (0.03%) on Wednesday and closed at 5,980.The Nasdaq 100 Index rose 0.61 point (0.0028%) and closed at 21,719.",

    "content": "US Final GDP data released on Thursday was a disappointment, with an annualized decrease in the first quarter of 2025 of 0.5%, revised downwards from the second estimate in May of -0.2%. The downward revision was due to decreases in consumer spending, exports and government spending.The first-quarter GDP release marks a sharp reversal from Q4 2024, in which the US economy expanded 2.4% year-on-year, and this is the first time in three years that the US economy has declined.The BEA noted that the current US Dollar GDP, which does not account for the impact of inflation on the current value of GDP, increased by 3.2% year-on-year, lower than the 3.4% gain in the second estimate.The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 3.4% in the first quarter, up from 3.3% in the second estimate. Similarly, the core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy and is closely watched by the Fed, rose 3.7% in Q1, up from 3.6% in the second estimate.Thursday’s weak GDP report is a clear indication that the US economy is slowing down, but the labour market remains surprisingly resilient. Initial jobless claims, released today, dropped to 236,000, down from an upwardly revised 246,000 in the previous release and below the consensus of 245,000. If the US labor market continues to post strong numbers, market expectations for a rate cut in the next few months will increase.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewUS Dollar Loses Ground, Stock Markets Slightly HigherIn the Forex market, the US dollar has retreated against all the major currencies in the aftermath of the GDP and unemployment claims report.

This seems to be mostly due to optimism that the US will now strike more reasonable trade deals with other nations and trading blocs (for example the EU) after agreeing to impose a relatively low 15% tariff on Japanese auto imports earlier this week. Risk-on sentiment has certainly been boosted. It is notable that it is the broad stock market that is outperforming the tech sector, withthe NASDAQ 100 Indexfailing to approach the S&P 500's strong performance yesterday.Precious metals remain in focus although they have mostly lost some ground over the past day. The stellar performer isSilverwhich reached a new 13-year high price yesterday.Goldalso traded well above $3,400 before giving up some of its gains and trading back below $3,400. Looking at other precious metals,Platinumhas not performed very well over recent days, butPalladiumhas.The industrial metal Copper has continued to advance strongly to fresh all-time highs and will be attractive to trend and momentum traders as it looks likely to rise further.Tesla is likely to drop today after releasing worse than expected earnings (revenue and profit) data for Q2 2025.The European central Bank will be holding a policy meeting today and is expected to hold its interest rate at 2.15% due to the risks inherent in its ongoing tariff negotiations with the USA. If the ECB surprises with a rate cut, the Euro will probably drop quite sharply, although it has been rising against the US over recent days, withthe EUR/USD currency pairremaining within a valid long-term bullish trend which is probably worth respecting.There will be releases today of high-impact Flash Serices and Manufacturing PMI data in the USA, Germany, the UK, and France.",

    "content": "Today’s rate announcement was significant as it marks the first time that the central bank has failed to lower rates since it started the current easing cycle in August 2024. The RBNZ had lowered rates at six consecutive meetings, chopping 225 basis points during that period. The benchmark rate has remained at its lowest level since August 2022.RBNZ statement: Uncertainty Requires CautionWhy the change in rate policy? The rate statement noted that the “economic outlook remains highly uncertain” and said that the rate path would depend on the following factors – the speed of the economic recovery, inflation and the impact of tariffs.At the same time, the RBNZ signaled that it would continue to loosen monetary policy if inflation continued to ease as the Bank has projected. The Bank released an updated inflation forecast which projected inflation moving towards the top of the Bank’s 1-3% target band in mid-2025 and easing to around 2% by early 2026 due to lower underlying inflation and spare capacity in the economy.The bottom line of the RBNZ rate decision? Today’s hold is likely a short breather rather than a change in monetary policy. The RBNZ signaled at the meeting that it plans to continue trimming rates in order to kick-start the struggling economy, assuming that the economy, and particularly inflation, evolves in line with the RBNZ’s forecasts.The New Zealand economy tipped into a recession last year and lower global demand has hurt the export-dependent economy. The markets expect at least one more rate cut before the end of the year but the rate path will largely depend on inflation and growth data.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewNew Zealand Dollar Steady, Stock Market Dips SharplyThe New Zealand dollar has shown a muted response to today’s rate decision.The NZD/USD currency pairis currently trading at 0.5993, down 0.07% on the day.

This was the second consecutive monthly rise in inflation, which is now at its highest level since February 2025. On a month-on-month basis, CPI rose to 0.3% from 0.1% in May, the largest increase in five months and matching the consensus.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, climbed to 2.9% from 2.8% but below the consensus of 3.0%. Monthly, the core rate rose 0.3%, up from 0.1% in May and matched the consensus.The hotter June inflation numbers were most likely driven by President Trump’s tariffs, which have raised the price on most products imported into the US. The tariffs, which were first imposed in April, did not show a spike in inflation until now and we can expect upcoming that the tariffs will also be felt in upcoming inflation reports as the tariffs continue to filter through the US economy.Today’s hot inflation report means pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower rates will ease. The money markets have priced a hold at the July 30 meeting at close to 100%, although the Fed is expected to resume cutting rates in the fourth quarter.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewCanada’s CPI Hits 1.9%Canada’s inflation rate also heated up in June. CPI rose to 1.9% year-on-year, up from 1.7% in May and in line with the consensus. Inflation remained below the Bank of Canada’s target rate of 2% for a third successive month. Monthly, CPI dropped to 0.1%, compared to 0.6% in May and matching the consensus expectation. The trimmed-mean core CPI, which the BoC uses as its preferred gauge for underlying inflation, was unchanged at 3% y/y, as expected. BoC policymakers won’t be losing any sleep over headline CPI, which remains below the 2% target, but would like to see core CPI ease before delivering a rate cut.US Dollar Shows Muted Reaction, US Stock Market Edges Higher After Inflation ReportThe US dollar is showing limited in the aftermath of today’s inflation report.

CPI remained at its lowest annual inflation rate since February 2021. Monthly CPI eased, rising to 0.2% from 0.3%, in line with market expectations. Gasoline and fuel oil prices continued to decline sharply, a key factor in easing inflation.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, moved in the opposite direction. Annual CPI climbed to 3.1% in July, up from 2.9% and above the market estimate of 3.0%. This marked the highest level in five months.

That is expected to change at the next Fed meeting, barring an extreme surprise. The markets have currently priced in a 94% likelihood of a rate cut at the Sep. 17 meeting, up sharply from 84% just before the inflation release.

Additionally, the article offers practical tips for implementing momentum strategies across various asset classes, including Forex and stock indices, while highlighting the key considerations traders should be aware of when using this method.What is Momentum TradingMomentum trading is a trading strategy that calls for buying or selling assets based on their historical price performances. It is a purely technical strategy depending entirely upon technical analysis of historical time series price data.The basic idea is that assets whose price has been going up are worth buying, on the belief that the price will continue to rise, while assets whose price has been going down are worth selling on the belief that the price will continue to fall.Momentum trading is a continuation strategy, not a reversal strategy.Momentum traders will decide upon a “universe” of tradable assets, and the criteria for determining when any of them are exhibiting strong enough momentum suitable for a trade entry.Momentum Trading Strategies - TypesThere are basically two types of momentum trading strategies:“Best of” Momentum Trading StrategiesHere, the trader monitors their universe of assets, and will look to go long of the asset or assets which are showing the strongest bullish momentum, and short of the asset or assets which are showing the strongest bearish momentum.For example, let’s suppose that a momentum trader builds a universe of the following tradable assets:This momentum trader uses a “best of” momentum strategy where at the start of each yearly quarter, he or she measures the performances of these assets over the previous quarter, and for the followin",

The UK’s tax-collecting authority, HM Revenues and Customs (HMRC) does not take kindly to people not paying their taxes. It seeks to recover unpaid taxes, impose fines, and sometimes pursue criminal proceedings. That is not a road anyone would wish to travel down.Do All Forex Traders Pay Taxes in the UK?I get asked this question most often, so let’s address it now. There are several scenarios where traders do not pay taxes on their trading profits:Everyone can make up to £1000 annually in trading profits without paying taxesSpread betting, as opposed to Contracts for Difference (CFDs), is tax-free so long as the HMRC does not view your trading as your profession (i.e. for example, trading regularly and making most of your income from it). The tax-free status of spread betting is mainly why people are drawn to it compared to CFDs.Individuals have a capital gains tax allowance (the Annual Exempt Amount) each tax year, allowing them to pay no tax on capital gains up to this level. The Annual Exempt Amount for the 2024/25 tax year is £3,000.UK Tax Classification According to the HMRCThree tax categories can apply to traders: Capital Gains, Income, and Corporation Tax.Capital Gains Tax (CGT)This is the most common tax CFD and Forex traders pay.

Ripple Labs started with the promise of providing its users a revolutionary payment protocols system for banking transactions with quicker times to settle the transfer of funds at cheaper costs.The value of XRP/USD has been very volatile since 2017. My Ripple price prediction for 2025 sees the coin trading between $1.15 and $8. By the year 2030 Ripple could be valued between $6 and $15. These forecasts are based on market sentiment and the utilitarian capabilities of Ripple via its XRP coin.The XRP/USD coin’s primary use is making the clearing of funds easier for financial institutions and businesses associated with them. XRP/USD not a 'standard' cryptocurrency like many of its major counterparts, the distributed ledger from Ripple is internal. Ripple Labs coding is ‘open source’, but XRP/USD uses a centralized system in which Ripple controls the allocation of the XRT coins, sometimes to the dismay of its skeptics.The fact that XRP/USD is centralized has become not only a ‘concern’ for many cryptocurrency influencers, but has also created a legal argument with the SEC. The Security Exchange Commission has in essence declared they believe the XRT coin is a ‘secured asset’, which would mean it has legal oversight domain. An official lawsuit was initiated by the SEC in December of 2020 against Ripple Labs and some of its executives. A contested fight within the U.S court system is anticipated.Is Ripple Undervalued?Ripple's XRP coin does not have an unlimited supply. The initial minting of XRP coins was said to be 100 billion.

There was a time when LTC/USD was rated within the top 5 of cryptocurrency market capitalizations as its proponents argued positively regarding its merits compared to the likes of Bitcoin. This caused a groundswell of support as people asked what the price of Litecoin would be several years in the future.Litecoin was essentially created in 2011. However the digital asset began trading in earnest with wide market interest in 2017 like many of its major counterparts, when cryptocurrencies jumped into the spotlight as their speculative gains caught the attention of the financial media. Like the other major cryptocurrencies, LTC/USD essentially went from a speculative asset few had ever heard of in early 2017 with a value of little more than nothing, to a digital asset that achieved a high price above $400 per coin in December that same calendar year. However, Litecoin then suffered a large fall in value over the coming year in line with the broader cryptocurrency market.Litecoin compared to Bitcoin was held up as a faster cryptocurrency regarding the ability to ‘mine’ its blockchain, and its transactional ability was also hailed as faster than Bitcoin, and these elements remain true to this day for the decentralized digital asset. However, not everything has been wine and roses for Litecoin early adapters, speculators and investors. Litecoin, like all cryptocurrencies, has enjoyed days of highs and extreme lows as technical and market behaviors have frequently caused storms.At the time of writing in August 2021, LTC/USD has gone through the whirlwind of its spring 2021 surge and slump like most of the major cryptocurrencies.

An additional lawsuit charges Budzinski with violating Fair Work policies by berating staff using homophobic slurs, threatening to withhold salaries, and sacking the entire Australian office. The question is, do the lawsuits hold merit, and what might the outcomes mean for the Australian and global retail trading industries?The second lawsuit, about Fair Work violations, targets the character of Budzinski in allegations made by a former disgruntled employee targeting Finohelp Support Pty Ltd., a support services company that assisted IC Markets with payroll. So, I will not dive into what may or may not have occurred, as it has no direct impact on CFD and Forex traders in Australia. The class action lawsuits should concern Australian-resident traders, however, as they could open the gates for more counter-productive regulatory changes, pushing Australia further behind competitive alternatives.What Should You Know Before We Look at The Allegations?Between 70% and 90% of retail traders lose money, which has less to do with leverage maximums and more to do with a lack of market education, discipline, and knowledge. Regulators cannot force traders to acquire the necessary knowledge to trade more profitably, or to use proper risk management, or comprehend the relationship between risk management, position sizing, and leverage. So, they lower the maximum leverage as a blunt regulatory tool. This gives the illusion",

The base currency (also known as transaction currency) is the initial currency mentioned in a currency pair quote, succeeded by the quote currency (also known as the counter currency). A financial firm can use the base currency as the accounting currency or domestic currency to reflect all profits or losses for financial reporting reasons.Base Currency Definition in ForexIn the Forex market, the base currency is the first of two currencies seen in a currency pair quote. After the base currency, the quotation mentions the counter currency. Let’s find out more about base currency and what it means in Forex.AdvertisementTake advantage of today's market opportunitiesSTART TRADING NOWUnderstanding base currencyThe base currency in a currency pair, such as USD/GBP, is the first currency specified (where the USD is the base currency). The quotation, also known as the counter currency, is the second currency. We generally expect the base currency to increase in respect of the quote/counter currency whether you \"long\" the currency pair. You would predict the reverse if you were \"short\" on the pair.What Are Examples of Base Currency?The euro versus the US dollar, generally known as EUR/USD, is the most frequently traded currency pair. Here's an illustration of how to understand currency pairs:It's 2024, and John is planning a trip to California. He lives in England and only carries pounds sterling. As a result, he goes to a forex agency to convert his GBP to USD. The rate is USD/GBP = 1.4, according to the Forex executive. This implies that $1 is worth 1.4 GBP.In my case, the quote currency is GBP, and the base currency is USD. As a result, John can swap 1.4 GBP for USD 1 at the Forex market.There are numerous distinct currency pairs around the world, and they are classified according to the frequency and magnitude of their dealings. The main currencies are defined as those that trade the largest",

    "content": "Forex trading is the latest market that blockchain technology is disrupting in 2025.The Forex market, which is operational 24/7, and blockchain, which provides the technological basis for cryptocurrency trading, are ideal for integration. Blockchain offers transparent, secure, fast, and cost-effective transaction methods. For this reason, the technology holds incredible promise for the Forex industry, although certain challenges need to be overcome. In this article, we'll dig deep into how blockchain has the potential to transform Forex trading, the pros and cons for the industry, and how this technology can be leveraged.Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow Blockchain WorksA blockchain is a ledger (a digital record of transactions) that executes secure transactions in a peer-to-peer network. It processes, stores, verifies, and records data automatically on the network, usually with a decentralized system. So, for two people to transact, there's no need for an intermediary such as a bank or payment processor.When a blockchain is decentralized, this means that no single entity has complete control. It can be governed communally, by hundreds, if not thousands, of network nodes. As a result, it is incredibly secure, as there's no single point of failure. That means that data cannot be modified or deleted without a network consensus.The primary use case for blockchain technology is that it allows people to transact cryptocurrencies, although blockchains can now integrate other types of data and use smart contracts. This enables the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can take real-world assets such as property and data onto the blockchain. So, when it comes to Forex trading, traditional fiat currency can be merged with blockchain technology to increase trade efficiency.Public vs Private BlockchainsThere are two distinct types of blockchains:Public blockchains are decentralized and open, so anyone can participate a",

    "content": "Intro to Trading StocksTop Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHere are ten essential takeaways for trading stocks:Buying a stock means buying a piece of a company. That’s why stocks are also called shares: owning a stock is owning a “share” of a company. If I buy one Apple share, it literally means I own a (tiny) piece of the company Apple.Companies issue stocks to raise capital to finance their business. When a company issues stocks for the first time, it is called an “Initial Public Offering” (IPO).A stock exchange is a centralized body that “lists” companies’ shares for brokers to buy and sell on behalf of their clients. The largest stock exchange in the world is the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE), with over two thousand different companies’ stocks. Stock exchanges are highly regulated to protect investors and companies participating in them.Some companies pay dividends, which are direct payments from their profits to the stock's owners. I remember my dad getting physical dividend checks from companies whose stocks he owned!Some trading instruments allow trading the price of a stock without physically buying and selling it. For example, CFDs and futures contracts can mirror the stock price but do not involve holding the stock itself. The advantage is trading on leverage and taking short positions, both of which are not always possible when trading the stock directly. The best stock brokers offer a wide selection of individual stocks for trading at competitive fees, overseen by sufficient regulation.Options contracts (i.e., “call” and “put” options) are also a popular method of trading stocks. They allow traders to access leverage, take short positions, and find unique ways to profit from stock price movements. For example, some option strategies allow traders to profit if a stock price stays in a specified range.The primary measure of a stock’s fundamental value is its price-earnings ratio or “PE.” This is the stock’s pr",

Bitcoin and gold could not be more different - gold reaches back to the history books, while Bitcoin is futuristic. However, with BTC’s current value and acceptance, comparing gold and Bitcoin has become a legitimate line of inquiry.Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewSo, let’s evaluate Bitcoin and gold, examining their regulations, security, utility, and comparative value.Bitcoin’s Emergence into the Gold “Space”In December 2024, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said in a live interview, “People use Bitcoin as a speculative asset. It’s like gold, only it’s virtual. It’s digital… It’s not a competitor for the dollar. It’s really a competitor for gold.”  Before using this as evidence to conclude the case in favor of Bitcoin replacing gold, I want to give the quote context: the interviewer’s question was primarily about Bitcoin versus the U.S. Dollar. Powell’s response was more about Bitcoin not competing with the U.S. Dollar. And this was a conversation, not an official statement recording the position of the Federal Reserve.However, Powell’s response was significant for two reasons:1) He is the Fed Chair2) He chose to compare it to gold without the interviewer asking about gold.Today, Bitcoin is tagged as the “Digital Gold.” What does this mean? When analysts talk about Bitcoin’s emergence into the gold “space,” they are referring to gold’s status as a strategic reserve. To understand the comparison between gold and Bitcoin means understanding the term “Strategic Reserve.”Features Making Gold a Strategic ReserveStore of value: Societies have universally recognized and traded gold for millennia, making it a reliable store of value.Safe-haven asset: People and governments flock to gold during economic uncertainty and crises, especially as a hedge during inflationary periods and currency devalua",

This knowledge and the strategies I adopted have been game-changers for me and many successful crypto traders.Let’s look at:Cryptocurrency day trading strategiesA step-by-step guideDos and Don’ts in day tradingWhat Is Crypto Day Trading?A cryptocurrency day trade involves entering a trading position in a cryptocurrency and then exiting the position in a short-term time frame, usually within the same day. For example, I buy Bitcoin at 10 a.m. and sell the position at 3 p.m. to complete a day trade.Cryptocurrency markets run 24/7 without an official opening or closing time each day. That means cryptocurrency day trading can happen at all hours of the day. The strict definition of day trading is to open and close a trading position on the same day. However, if a position remains open a little more than a day, I also classify that as day trading for the sake of this article.That means day trading has a short-term focus on immediate moves that require precise timing to catch.Why Day Trade Cryptos and Bitcoin?Liquidity and VolatilityThe best markets for day trading are those with liquidity and volatility. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are highly liquid and volatile, making them excellent for day trading.Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its market price. For an asset to be liquid, it must have a large market capitalization and plenty of trading volume. Bitcoin's market capitalization was over $1 trillion in February 2024 and reached over $2 trillion one year later.But there’s no point in day trading a market if it barely moves in price, n",

The answer to that is yes, forex trading is totally legal in Pakistan.There are essentially no limits to forex trading in Pakistan. Of course, there has been some action taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) to reduce the risk of financial fraud and money laundering in the forex market. So far, we’ve covered only the legal aspect of forex trading in Pakistan.Is Forex Trading Legal According to Islamic Law?Although forex is legal according to Sharia law, there is a more complicated answer to this question. According to Islamic law, forex trading is halal as long as you keep a few important and morally-acceptable practices in mind.First of all, it is essential that you only use an interest-free forex account. As it is well known, interest is haram in Islam, and there is no exception to that rule.

I began trading Forex in the early 2000s. Before then, only institutions and high-net-worth individuals, usually requiring a minimum account size of $500,000, were able to trade currencies. At the time, most retail traders focused on equities and equity options, with a small proportion also trading futures contracts. When retail Forex emerged, it immediately exploded in popularity and quickly became the hot new thing.Retail traders had never seen an asset class like it, and Forex trading introduced many first experiences. For example, Forex was the first time many traders encountered leverage, and the first time they learned about over-the-counter markets that operated without centralized exchanges. In fact, because new Forex brokers advertised heavily to the public, retail Forex encouraged many to try trading for the first time.The emergence of retail Forex also helped increase the popularity of technical analysis methodology.Then, in 2005, MetaTrader 4 was introduced, specifically for Forex brokers. Before MetaTrader, most independent trading platforms required costly subscriptions or purchases. MetaTrader was free and used by almost all Forex brokers, making it immediately popular. Traders then started sharing MetaTrader trading templates (e.g., indicator settings) and automated systems (Expert Advisors), subscribing to signals and copying trades from other MetaTrader users. Suddenly, thanks to MetaTrader, many traders began collaborating",

    "content": "Following the RBNZ cutting its Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 50 basis points (bps) in November 2024, economists and investors expect another bumper 50 bp rate reduction on Wednesday this week – with an outside chance of a more minor 25 bp reduction. A 50 bp (25 bp) adjustment would bring the OCR to 3.75% (4.00%). In addition, markets are also expecting another 75 bps worth of cuts this year.Sluggish Economic ActivityI’ve observed little reason to stray from market pricing and expect an additional 50 bp cut this week. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth fell into a technical recession in Q3 24 after printing a second consecutive quarter in negative territory; the -1.5% contraction was the lowest figure since Q2 20. Additionally, unemployment has risen to its highest level since late 2020 at 5.1% (Q4 24), and given inflation remains within the RBNZ’s 1-3% target band – Q4 24 inflation increased to 2.2% (matching the 2.2% print in Q3 24) – the central bank has ‘room’ to lower the OCR.With a 50 bp cut largely baked in, and assuming the central bank follows through, I expect a knee-jerk sell-off across New Zealand dollar (NZD) pairs. That said, most focus will be on any change in the rate statement’s language, press conference commentary, and any revisions in the updated economic projections.NZD/USD Vulnerable to the DownsidePrice action on the monthly timeframe for the NZD/USD (New Zealand dollar versus the US dollar) came within a stone’s throw of testing long-term support from US$0.5511 this month. Anyone following candlestick patterns may note that the current monthly candle is poised to close by way of a bullish engulfing formation. While monthly support is clear, and the bullish engulfing pattern indicates buyers may want to explore higher terrain, the rebound in October 2022 failing to print a meaningful high may concern long-term bulls. Couple this with the overall long-term trend facing south, and any higher rebound could be short-lived.This brings me to the daily",

In short, all South African residents must declare their Forex profits for tax purposes, and there is no getting around it. Like most nations’ revenue-collecting services, SARS will impose penalties for not paying taxes.Let’s look at how SARS taxes Forex trading and explore some tax planning strategies that Forex traders can use.Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow Are Forex Trading Profits Taxed in South Africa?Forex trading profits are subject to regular income tax rates in South Africa (unless an individual has set up a company for their Forex trading). Taxpayers can deduct trading-related expenses (e.g., computer equipment, trading courses, software, etc.) from their Forex profits to reduce their taxable income.SARS publishes the applicable “tax rates for individuals” here on its website. Individual tax rates are a progressive system with higher percentages at higher income levels. The lowest tax rate is 18%, and the highest is 45% above a specified income level. Each year, SARS adjusts the income levels for each percentage income tax rate.The Provisional Tax payment system applies to Forex trading profits because trading is not a salaried activity under the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax-paying system. Let’s examine how the Provisional Tax system works.What Is Provisional Tax?Forex trading gains are subject to the SARS “provisional tax” payment method.Although “provisional tax” sounds like a separate tax type, like income tax, or inheritance tax it is not. Instead, it is a method of spreading tax payments to SARS over the year instead of in one annual lump sum at the end of the tax year. SARS uses the provisional tax payment system to even out cash flow for taxpayers, rather than facing them with a large single payment at the end of the ye",

I.e. Spot Forex income is subject to federal income tax brackets.Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 988 covers Spot Forex.The beginning of IRC 988 reads, “… any foreign currency gain or loss attributable to a section 988 transaction shall be computed separately and treated as ordinary income or loss (as the case may be).” Click here for the text of IRC 988 (published by Cornell Law School).In IRC 988, the losses you can write off against your income are unlimited.

    "content": "Markets have been roiled by US President Trump’s announcement of strong new tariffs on all trading partners, followed by a 90-day suspension. How this process plays out will be key to the future of the markets over 2025 and probably beyond.1. The Trump administration is committed to implementing tariffs.2. The administration is willing to enforce tariffs at levels that match the rhetoric.I believe this second realization, i.e., the sheer levels of the tariffs the U.S. was willing to enact, was the primary catalyst that caused much of the global equity markets’ sell-off in early April 2025.The proposed tariff levels are massively uneven among nations, depending on the Trump administration’s view of how specific nations contribute to a trade deficit. Negotiations between world leaders and Trump’s team are happening at a pace that alters the landscape daily.Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewWhere We Stand NowAt the time of writing, Trump paused global reciprocal tariffs for 90 days from April 9, with one notable exception: China. His pause followed days of equity and bond markets' sell-off that could have led to a financial meltdown, and the U.S. public would have widely considered Trump responsible in such an event. In my mind, Trump’s team underestimated the market decline and loss of public support that would follow the tariff announcements, hence the abrupt pause.However, the Trump administration will seemingly continue a baseline 10% tariff on most nations that started on April 5. Had it not been for the extra tariffs and market volatility, this alone would be a headline news item.The exception for China is stark. Currently, the U.S. has set a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, and China has retaliated with an 84% tariff on U.S. goods—numbers that would have been unthinkable a week ago. The U.S. is in a trade war with China, with neither country wishing to back down, and neither country has an off-ramp. This is uncharted t",

    "content": "What is the US30?US30 is a common ticker name for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The DJIA is a major stock average in the USA which is always composed of 30 publicly traded companies listed on US stock exchanges.The DJIA has been around for a long time. It was first created as an indicator to gauge the state of the American stock market in the late 19th century. However, it has been somewhat overtaken by broader, more modern stock indices such as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100 indices. In particular, the S&P 500 Index has taken the DJIA’s old role as the barometer of the American stock market.The DJIA is price weighted, unlike modern stock indices, which are weighted by market capitalisation.The DJIA’s member companies are typically old “blue chip” companies which are involved in industrial processes, and as such, is somewhat less relevant to the modern American economy, which has become increasingly service based since the 1960s.What Is One Pip Change in US30?A pip change is the measurement used for change amounts within an exchange rate of a currency pair. It’s calculated from the last decimal point. Most major currency pairs are priced to within four decimal places, so the smallest change could be 1/100 or one percent (0.0001), which is one basis point.However, currency crosses for the Japanese Yen (EUR/JPY) have a pip of 0.01. For metals like silver and gold, a pip is 0.01 on the US30.Here’s an example: the GBP/USD moves from 1.3935 to 1.3936, so there is one pip change. If you’re using a five-digit broker and the GBP/USD moves from 1.39355 to 1.39360, there’s a half a pip change (0.5 pip).Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow to Measure Pips in BTC/USD on US30When measuring pips for BTC/USD pairs on the US30, it’s similar to when you’re trading gold - XAU/USD.

As of 2025, 137 countries, making up 98% of global GDP, are engaged in researching, developing, and piloting national CBDCs.Governments are racing to launch digital currencies into their economies to avoid being left behind in an industry predicted to reach $213 billion in transaction volume by 2030.In the article, you’ll learn why countries are launching CDBCs, how China’s e-CNY is leading the way, and the challenges facing central banks in their quest for digital transformation.What is a CBDC?A Central Bank Digital Currency or ‘CDBC’ is a digital form of a sovereign nation's legal currency. Most often, they are blockchain-based cryptocurrencies that are issued and controlled by governments or central authorities. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, a government-issued CDBC is legal tender and can be used for payments of goods or services.The concept of CDBCs is still relatively new, and very few nations have actually launched this new style of digital money. Most countries are still developing, testing, and piloting CDBCs, but they are likely to be officially implemented with increasing speed over the coming years.While the architecture is still being designed, most will rely on a two-tier system where a country's central bank issues the coins, and commercial banks are responsible for distribution. CBDCs rely on blockchain technology to deliver 24/7, instant settlement, while smart contracts enable deeper levels of financial automation.Motivations for CBDC AdoptionA big attraction for governments is the traceability and transaction history recorded on a blockchain network. This provides complete traceability for ‘digital cash’ compared to traditional notes and coins, which are not traceable.Centralized control is a significant factor in the distinction between CDBCs and traditional cryptocurrencies.

    "title": "How Market Volatility Affects Execution",
    "slug": "how-market-volatility-affects-execution",
    "content": "Volatility is a hot topic for financial educators, traders, and investors. If you are unfamiliar with the term, it refers to a scenario where market prices rapidly rise and drop within a very short period. Depending on their trading or investing style, some skilled or even professional traders may actively avoid or choose to trade during volatility. Although potential rewards may be more significant during volatility, the risk increases exponentially.Although there is no direct correlation between volatility and execution, trying to open a trade while prices are moving rapidly can lead to price differences between what a trader expects and what they get. It’s like trying to hit a rapidly moving target with a ball, something that’s relatively challenging. In the best-case scenario, your trade may open at a more beneficial rate. In the worst-case scenario, your trade opens at a rate that causes unforeseen losses or yields a smaller return than intended.Exness helps traders mitigate this by filling their orders at the best market price available at the given moment. Thanks to a robust infrastructure of strategically located servers worldwide, their order execution* is both fast and reliable.What causes volatility?Several factors fuel volatility, but in simple terms, it occurs when traders are unsure about an event, news item, or political occurrence that will affect the markets. Here’s a more specific breakdown of these factors.NewsInformation can come from any source, but as long as it reaches an audience of market participants likely to spread market-moving news, that information can have an impact. These include traditional financial media like Forbes, Bloomberg, and the Wall Street Journal, as well as social media and trading communities like those on Discord.GeopoliticsDuring the beginning of 2025, the new US administration waffled on tariffs. The enacted ones triggered retaliatory tariffs from the targeted countries, resulting in volatility as markets feared a ra",

    "content": "Trading fees are often accepted as part of the cost of trading — a necessary friction in an otherwise fluid market. But for serious traders, these costs are more than incidental — they’re a performance lever.However, the true cost of trading goes beyond visible charges. It’s embedded in the structure behind each trade — from slippage and spread behavior to platform reliability under pressure. In this sense, cost-efficiency isn’t just about low fees — it’s about the structural integrity of the entire trading experience.This is where PrimeXBT stands out. With low fees, a transparent pricing model, and a stable, high-performance platform, it delivers cost efficiency by design. Its VIP Tiers program plays a central role in that structure — helping traders save more when they trade.What traders often overlookWhile most traders pay attention to headline fees like commissions or taker rates, many of other costs live in the background.Latency, the time it takes for a trade to execute, can quietly affect entry and exit points.Slippage, the difference between expected and actual execution price, becomes especially costly in volatile markets.Spread widening during news events or low-liquidity periods can inflate the cost of a trade well beyond what was anticipated.Platform overload is when a platform lags or freezes during high-activity moments, the result isn’t just frustration — it's a missed opportunity.These aren’t hypothetical scenarios. For active traders, they’re part of the daily reality — and they add up.That’s why low fees alone aren’t enough — and experienced traders know it. Some platforms advertise “zero commission” models but quietly make up for it with wide spreads, restricted access to tools, or hidden charges. Others place essential features behind paywalls or limit asset access unless higher account types are unlocked.How PrimeXBT is built differentlyPrimeXBT addresses the hidden friction points of trading with infrastructure built for speed, stability, and c",

From day one, the founding team focused on building strong operational systems and transparent processes. This robust infrastructure set the groundwork for years of consistent performance and future growth.A notable early step in this phase was the adoption of the MetaTrader 4 (MT4) platform. MT4 was and remains a leading trading solution for forex and CFD traders because of its speed, stability, and array of technical tools.By integrating this trusted platform, the company gave its clients a reliable research and trading management environment with features like one-click trading and customisable charting, and highlighting the belief that every trader deserves access to world-class tools.Compliance was another early pillar for the broker. Obtaining its first regulatory licence not only enabled the company to operate in reputable jurisdictions but also helped build trust among its expanding user base. Financial regulation requires rigorous policies on funds segregation and transparency, to name a few. The early commitment to being a regulated broker set a standard for reliable operation that has been sustained ever since.Offices were opened in major financial centres, including London, Sydney, and Johannesburg, to meet international demand.

It is widely expected that the annualized rate will remain unchanged at 2.4%, with month-on-month CPI expected to show an increase of 0.3%. If the data is higher than expected, that could boost the USD and sink US stocks; if lower than expected, the opposite will be likely.The big news yesterday was the announcement of a trade deal between the USA and China, who have been engaged in a noisy and destructive trade war since Trump took office in January. It was agreed that during an upcoming 90-day period for further negotiations, the US would drop tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China would drop tariffs on US imports from 125% to 10%. The US Dollar and US stock markets immediately jumped and held these increases, with the NASDAQ 100 Index up by 4.4% on the day and the S&P 500 Index closing higher by 3.3%. Asian stock markets have mostly continued this rally, although Chinese indices are trading lower today. This news is likely to be bullish for global risk-on sentiment generally, including stock markets.Following yesterday's trade deal between the USA and China, markets are now expecting only 2 US rate cuts over the course of 2025, at 0.25% each, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The first cut is not expected until September.In the Forex market, since today's Tokyo open, the Australian Dollar has been the strongest major currency, while the USD has been the weakest, putting the AUD/USD currency pair in focus - the Aussie typically gains when global risk sentiment improves. However, it can be said that the USD strength we saw yesterday is likely to hold up over the coming days.Bitcoin dropped quite sharply yesterday after coming close to testing its record high made",

    "content": "The US consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-on-year in July, unchanged from the June figure and below the market estimate of 2.8%. CPI remained at its lowest annual inflation rate since February 2021. Monthly CPI eased, rising to 0.2% from 0.3%, in line with market expectations. Gasoline and fuel oil prices continued to decline sharply, a key factor in easing inflation.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, moved in the opposite direction. Annual CPI climbed to 3.1% in July, up from 2.9% and above the market estimate of 3.0%. This marked the highest level in five months. Monthly, the core rate rose 0.3%, up from 0.2% and in line with the market estimate.The rise in core CPI reflects the effect of Trump's tariffs, which took effect in April and continue to filter through the economy. The tariffs are expected to dampen growth and raise inflation, as US consumers pay more for imported goods.Inflation Report Likely Cements Rate Cut in SeptemberThe Federal Reserve has been on an extended pause and hasn't lowered interest rates since December 2024. That is expected to change at the next Fed meeting, barring an extreme surprise. The markets have currently priced in a 94% likelihood of a rate cut at the Sep. 17 meeting, up sharply from 84% just before the inflation release. Investors were clearly relieved that CPI remained at 2.7% and didn't rise to 2.8% as expected, anticipating that this will clear the path for the Fed to lower rates next month.US Dollar Shows Muted Response, Stock Market Edges Higher after Inflation ReportThe US dollar is showing little reaction following the release of the US inflation report, while the US stock market is in positive territory.The GBP/USD currency pair is trading at 1.3482, up 0.35% on the day, but most of these gains were recorded ahead of the inflation release.The US stock market has posted gains on Tuesday, as investors reacted positively to the inflation report.The S&P 500",

The pair continued to move around the 34.50 lira levels without any significant improvement or decline after the interest rate decision issued by the Turkish Central Bank last Thursday, which kept the interest rate unchanged for the eighth consecutive time at 50%. Moreover, the Central Bank's decision did not contradict the expectations that prevailed in the markets.The decision came with the aim of continuing to curb inflation, which showed a higher rise than market expectations over the months of September and October. Despite the continued monetary tightening, the bank's statement issued after the interest rate decision did not overlook pointing to the approaching cycle of easing monetary policy in the near future. Bank analysts \"Goldman Sachs\" and \"Morgan Stanley\" expect this phase to begin next month, or by the beginning of next year, 2025. Obviously, these expectations may be closer to realization if inflation rates for the month of November record a significant decline compared to previous months.Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewFurthermore, the data issued over the past months showed a continued decline in inflation in the country, but it was a disappointing slo",

The Central Bank of Turkey approved the first interest rate cut in December by 250 basis points.

Concurrently, Most estimates indicate that the interest rate will be held steady after the bank cut the interest rate by 250 basis points in the December meeting.Previously, the Turkish Central Bank had announced new steps within the framework of its strategy to reduce the \"protected deposit accounts against foreign exchange fluctuations\" program, as part of the gradual shift towards more traditional economic policies. As of January 20, 2025, opening and renewing protected accounts with maturities of six and 12 months will be stopped, according to a statement by the central bank. The statement also explained that this step aims to reduce the protected deposit program, which was launched in December 2021 to support the stability of the Turkish lira and reduce dollarization. The program, which guaranteed depositors protection against exchange rate fluctuations, was criticized for its high cost and negative impact on the budget.

Recently, the Central Bank of Turkey has adopted a strategy aimed at enhancing the attractiveness of the Turkish lira to investors by offering high returns. Obviously, this strategy is based on allowing the lira to depreciate against the dollar but ensuring that the rate of depreciation is less than the inflation rate. Furthermore, this approach aims to reduce the impact of currency weakness on rising prices.Over the past year, the lira has depreciated by 16% against the dollar in nominal terms. However, when taking inflation into account, the lira recorded significant gains, the best since 2007. This policy provided a unique opportunity for foreign investors, as they could achieve returns of over 50% by investing in Turkish lira bonds, making it one of the most attractive options in the financial markets.At the same time, the report indicated an improvement in the value of the lira, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan",

This is an area that’s been important a couple of times in the past but at this point in time it looks like it is still going to be thought of as a target. If we can break above there, then the market is likely to continue to go higher, perhaps opening up a move to the $35.50 level. Short-term pullbacks should continue to be potential buying opportunities in this market, as it obviously has a lot of underlying upward pressure. I don’t think things change very quickly.GoldGold markets continue to be very noisy, and it is worth noting that we did sell off during the day on Thursday, but quite frankly I think this is a market that any time we get some type of decent pullback, people will be willing to step in and pick up “cheap gold.” I believe that the $3200 level underneath is a significant support level, as it was significant previously, and then after that we have the $3000 level that could offer a bit of a short-term floor as well. After all, there is a large, round, psychologically significant aspect of that level.WTI Crude OilThe West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil market has a definite air of positivity under it, with the $60 level offering support. The market looks as if it is going to try to get to the $65 level sooner rather than later, and if we can break above there, it’s very possible that the WTI Crude Oil market could break even higher than that, perhaps making a run toward the $70 level.

    "content": "USD/JPYThe US dollar initially fell against the Japanese yen but has found enough support near the 140 level to turn things around and bounce quite significantly. It’s interesting, because the 140 level has been a major support level going back some time now, and it’s also worth noting that the 200 Week EMA sits there as well. By forming this massive hammer, and the fact that some of the rhetoric out there has gone off the rails, it’s starting to look more and more like the US dollar is in the process of bottoming. Furthermore, the Japanese yen looks like it is giving up some of that strength.USD/CHFThe US dollar initially fell during the course of the week to break down below the 0.81 level, only to turn around and bounce all the way toward the 0.83 level. The US dollar looks like it is ready to rally from here, but whether or not it can change the overall trend is a completely different question. If we can break above the 0.84 level, then I think we have a situation where we could rise as high as 0.8750 level. However, if we turn around a breakdown below the weekly candlestick, then we could drop to the 0.80 level eventually.GBP/USDThe British pound has rallied significantly during the course of the week, but it found the 1.34 level to be far too resistant to continue. By doing so, we ended up forming a bit of a shooting star. This is a market that is overbought, so a pullback makes quite a bit of sense at this point in time. In fact, I am seeing this across the board when it comes to the US dollar, so I think all things are leading to the same scenario, where the greenback is suddenly going to strengthen. That being said, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the British pound will fall apart, just that we have certainly gotten too far ahead of ourselves. However, if we were to break above the 1.34 level on a weekly close, we could really start to accelerate to the upside.Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThere are",

The Central Bank continues to intervene amidst the sharp fluctuations witnessed in global markets due to statements by US President Donald Trump, ranging from passing tariff increases to postponing them for 90 days. Consequently, these fluctuations have widened a wave of intense foreign capital outflows. During the period between March 14th and 28th, outflows of 14 billion dollars were recorded from foreign investment portfolios.According to data published on X, the Turkish Central Bank injected approximately 10.7 billion dollars from its foreign currency reserves in just two days, distributed between 7.6 billion dollars on April 7th and 3.1 billion dollars on the 8th of this month. This brings the total amount spent by the Turkish government since the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu on March 19th to about 42.7 billion dollars, in an attempt to contain the deterioration of the",

The ECB seems to feel quite confident that it has inflation beaten, and ironically this may be boosting the Euro as a new safe-haven currency.Another major item was lower than expected inflation in both the UK and in Canada, which is adding to the growing “inflation beaten” narrative.The Bank of Canada held its Overnight Rate at 2.75%.US Retail Sales data came in a little stronger than expected.Finally, President Trump has been publicly criticizing Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting rates more quickly, and is publicly musing on studying replacing him, although it is hard to see how this could be executed.

The 1.3750 level is an area that is very important, and at this point in time, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of volatility and potential support, but at this point, I would need to see the US dollar recapture the 1.39 level to begin to think about buying against the Canadian dollar, despite the fact that there is still no trade agreement between the 2 economies.Crude OilThe crude oil markets have been all over the place during the week, as we tested the $65 level but then turned around to show signs of hesitation. The $60 level seems to be offering support, and if we can stay above that level, then I think you’ve got a real opportunity to go back and forth on short-term chart. I think that’s probably the most likely turn of events, but Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs being recommended against the European Union starting June 1, and that could be negative for oil, only time will tell. If we can recapture the $65 level on a daily close, then I think crude oil can rally quite nicely.USD/JPYThe US dollar fell rather significantly during the trading week against the Japanese yen, and now that we have more chaos involving tariffs, it’s possible that we could see the Japanese yen continue to strengthen. This flies in the face of the interest rate situation, and at this point in time I am fairly neutral about this pair. I believe there is a ton of support between current levels in the ¥140 level, so I am looking for stability and a turnaround to start buying.

With that being said, it’s probably worth noting that we are seeing hesitation above the $3.400 level for the 3rd week in a row. This doesn’t necessarily mean that gold is going to fall apart, but I do think we have some work to do to get moving. That being said, you should also keep in mind that the US and Chinese delegates meet this weekend.GBP/USDThis is one of the most interesting charts for me on the weekly timeframe in the world of forex. Quite frankly, we are struggling mightily to break above the 1.34 level, and the fact that we are finishing the week with a candlestick that looks a lot like a shooting star, and preceded by 2 actual shooting stars, tells me that we are on the precipice of a potential strengthening of the US dollar. By contrast, if we can break above the 1.35 level, the British pound could soar at that point, perhaps picking up another 500 pips. Nonetheless, it’s worth noting that there are several charts starting to hint that the US dollar is potentially going to make a comeback.USD/CADThis is one of those charges I was speaking about. The engulfing candlestick on the weekly chart suggest that buyers have stepped in and started buying the greenback against the Canadian dollar in mass. This makes sense, as Canada still does not have a trade deal with its most important trading partner, the United States. By extension, this means that the Canadian economy is going to remain under pressure, and therefore I think we will see the greenback continue higher.Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThis is an interesting chart as well, as we have seen market participants go in both directions all week, as we tested the 1.12 level at the very lows, but have since bounced quite nicely.

I suspect at this point the DAX will go looking to the €25,000 level.USD/JPYThe US dollar initially fell during the week against the Japanese yen, but the ¥145 level has offered support. All things being equal, this is a market that continues to see a lot of volatility, but there are a lot of buyers underneath that will continue to come into the market and choose the US dollar due to the interest rate differential, as the Bank of Japan has absolutely no real chance of tightening anytime soon.

The talks, involving key officials like US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, aim to reduce tariffs, previously 145% on Chinese goods and 125% on US exports—that have disrupted supply chains and raised recession fears.A potential deal could stabilize equities, increase risk appetite, and drive capital into assets like Bitcoin, seen as a hedge against economic uncertainty.Reduced tariffs could also weaken the US dollar, enhancing Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value. Additionally, positive trade outcomes may counter inflationary pressures from upcoming CPI data, reducing fears of tighter Federal Reserve policies that could dampen crypto markets.Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May is due for reading on Wednesday, June 11, with markets fearing that a negative outcome of the US-China talks could add pressure on market prices.Market analysts project the US CPI to rise 0.3% month-over-month and 2.3% year-over-year.

    "content": "The month of June was very volatile for the crude oil markets worldwide, as Israel and Iran going to war obviously causes quite a bit of heartburn when it comes to crude oil supply and how people will look at pricing it.That being said, we have since seen the Israelis and Iranians agreed to a cease-fire, and all of that volatility and massive move to the upside has simply rolled right back over.In other words, we have seen the market rally all the way from $65 to the $79 region or so and then drop right back down to the $65 level again. June has been an absolute migraine inducing environment.Are We Recovering Finally?Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewI have a little bit different take on the crude oil market at the moment than most people. What I’ve noticed is that there is a significant amount of hesitation near the $65 level, and that is an area that previously had been significant resistance over the course of about 2 months. The market finding a bit of sideways action in that region makes a certain amount of sense because of the “market memory”, but I also believe that crude oil was trying to break out to the upside before conflict broke out between Iran and Israel. That ended up being the catalyst to really get things moving, but now that we are back where we started, I think they are looking to recover a bit in the month of July.This doesn’t necessarily mean that we take off to the stratosphere, but I think what it means is that the market is going to continue to grind higher more than anything else. Cyclically speaking, this is typically a very positive time of year for crude oil, and unless we get some type of external shock over the next month, it’s likely that we will start to focus on that again. After all, demand picks up in the United States, as well as the European Union during the summer, all things being equal. I am bullish, but I also expected to be a very choppy and slow grind higher.Ready to trade mon",

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 9% over the last week and 35% over the last 90 days.With a market capitalization of $298 billion, Ether cements its position as the second most valuable cryptocurrency, according to the CoinMarketCap ranking.Apart from the uptrend in the wider crypto market fueled by increased inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs and Bitcoin’s rally to $108,000 over the weekend, other fundamental factors and onchain metrics back Ethereum’s potential to follow in BTC’s footsteps to reach new all-time highs and possibly top out at $10,000 in 2025.Dwindling Exchange SupplyOne factor supporting Ether’s upside is reducing supply on exchanges. Data from onchain market intelligence firm Glassnode shows Ether’s reserve on exchanges reached a nine-year low of 16.15 million ETH on June 23, after dropping 10% over the last 90 days.ETH Exchange Supply. Source: GlassnodeThe total balance between inflows and outflows in and out of all known exchange wallets shows a steep decline since October 2023, when withdrawals from the crypto trading platforms began to surge. This drop accompanies a 130% rise in ETH price over the same period.Decreasing ETH supply on exchanges simply means investors could be withdrawing their tokens into self-custody wallets. This indicates a lack of intention to sell in anticipation of a price increase in the future.This is explained by a spike in accumulation by large holders over the last few weeks. More data from Glassnode shows that wallets holding $100,000 and $1 million or more worth of ETH have been on the rise since the start of April.Number of ETH Wallets with Balances > $100K and $1M.

Gains extended to the 1.1641 resistance level at the time of writing, marking the pair's highest point since 2021. The Euro's gains increased amid the US dollar's weak performance as traders continue to assess the situation in the Middle East. Recently, US President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which eased concerns about potential supply disruptions in the energy sector. However, the truce is being tested as Israel has already accused Iran of violating the agreement.On the economic front, business sentiment in Germany improved, according to the Ifo Index, reaching its highest level in almost a year. However, preliminary PMI indicators painted a mixed picture, with private sector activity in the Eurozone showing signs of stabilization. Meanwhile, concerning monetary policy, analysts still expect a 25-basis-point interest rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB) before the end of the year. For her part, ECB Governor Lagarde stated that \"at current interest rate levels, we believe we are well-positioned to navigate uncertain conditions,\" while Governing Council member Villeroy de Galhau said the ECB could still cut rates in the first half of next year.Trading Advice:Despite the gains, we still advise selling the Euro against the US Dollar from every upward level, but without taking risks, while closely monitoring f",

However, it's crucial to consider that a new rise for the Euro necessitates a period of anticipation. The probability of an EUR/USD exchange rate decline is increasing, as technical readings suggest it may have exceeded its acceptable limits in recent hours.

As mentioned before, the $3300 per ounce resistance will remain a strong catalyst for bulls to advance technically.Will gold prices rise soon?According to gold analysts' forecasts, spot gold prices are expected to see a sharp increase due to escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, ignited by news of a US airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities. This development is driving strong demand for safe-haven gold bullion. Consequently, analysts now expect gold prices to range between $3500 and $3700 per ounce, as investors hedge against geopolitical instability and inflation risks.On the other hand, there is a catalyst for the gold market.

According to performance across gold trading platforms, selling pressure on the yellow metal increased as financial markets assessed the sustainability of the ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Tehran and Tel Aviv had agreed to a temporary ceasefire after exchanging strikes since last week. However, reports of fresh missile launch, and strike orders raised scepticism about the truce's validity and fuelled concerns that the conflict would soon resume.Furthermore, this occurred after the exchange of controlled strikes between Iran and the United States minimized collateral damage and preceded a period of apparent de-escalation. This reduced gold's appeal as a safe haven and prevented its price from retesting record highs of $3,500 in late April. Meanwhile, key FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) members indicated they are not opposed to a US interest rate cut in the Federal Reserve's upcoming July meeting, amid signs of a wavering labour market and disinflation in consumer prices.Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewTrading Tips:The strategy of buying gold on dips is still valid, and it's the best approach for considering gold trading in the coming days.The movement of technical indicators hasn't changed much after gold's recent losses.

That being said, the market has pulled back just a bit, but I think we still see plenty of support near the ¥142 level, and I do think that we might be in the midst of a bottoming pattern. Furthermore, we are starting to see the US dollar stiffen it’s resolve against the basket of major currencies that we typically followed. In other words, we may be in the middle of turning things around.GBP/USDThe British pound initially did try to rally during the course of the week but gave back gains. All things being equal, the market looks as if it is going to be watching the crucial 1.35 level, as it is a major support level, based on the fact that it has been a major resistance barrier. All things being equal, the “market memory” should come into the picture, but if we break down below that level, then I think the British pound might find itself in a little bit of trouble. On the other hand, if we can break above the 1.3650 level, the British pound could really start to take off.DAXThe German index did rally a bit during the course of the week, but it is starting to show signs of hesitation around the €24,000 level. At this point, the market might be a little bit overbought, and while we broke above a major resistance barrier, we got there so quickly that I think a little bit of sideways action probably makes a certain amount of sense.

We are currently in the middle of a lot of choppy behavior, and I think we have a situation where market participants will have to look at this from a short-term perspective more than anything else, as we look like we are trying to find a reason to continue the overall uptrend but just do not have it at the moment.WTI Crude OilThe WTI Crude Oil market had a very strong week, breaking toward the crucial $65 level. The market breaking above the $65 level is a very positive sign, so I will be watching that this week. A move above could open up a move to the $68 level, possibly even the $72.50 level. Underneath, we have a massive amount of support near the $60 level, so as long as we can stay above there, I still think there are plenty of buyers in this market as the US economy is stronger than the market had been pricing in previously, if the jobs numbers are to be believed.NASDAQ 100The NASDAQ 100 rallied for the week, breaking above the 21,800 level, and threatening overall highs near 42,100. All things being equal though, the market is a little bit extended, and I think we may see some choppy behavior as we try to push through the major swing high that we had melted down from.

This of course has people running toward safety currency such as the US dollar, so it does make sense that we have seen hesitation. However, earlier in the week we had seen quite a bit of bullish pressure, so one would have to assume that there is at least some demand out there for the euro. I suspect the next couple of weeks will be very violent but may have a bit of a bid for them.USD/MXNThe US dollar spent most of the week falling against the Mexican peso, but turned around after the airstrikes, and because of this we are sitting right at the 200 Week EMA. We are also at the crucial 19 MXN level, so if we were to bounce from here it would make a certain amount of sense, but I see a lot of resistance near the 19.40 MXN level, so whether or not it is going to truly rally remains to be seen, I think that could be an area where we could see some issue. A break above the 50 Week EMA could send this pair to the 20 MXN level.GBP/USDThe British pound has been all over the place during the week, as we continue to see a lot of questions asked of the US dollar. That being said, after the airstrikes on Friday, we have seen a little bit of a pushback against risk-taking, so it’ll be interesting to see how this plays out.

Ultimately, we are just simply sitting in the middle of the range at approximate “fair value”, so now we need another catalyst. Ultimately though, I prefer the upside.NASDAQ 100The NASDAQ 100 is slightly positive for the week, but ultimately this is a situation where we are consolidating as well, with the 22,000 level as a major resistance barrier. If we can break above there, the market could take off to the upside and really, I think we’ve got a situation where we have just simply a bit of consolidation, as we have rocketed far too quickly to the upside.

This of course has taken some of the “risk premium” out of the market for crude oil, as tensions in the Middle East seem to be slowing down a bit. Because of this, I think you have a situation where traders simply got rid of those “panic longs”, as we had gotten far too ahead of ourselves.

That being said, now that the situation in the Middle East has calmed down, I think we will focus on things like central bank buying, the idea that the Federal Reserve is going to cut later this year, and of course the overall momentum trade. Because of this, traders will more likely than not look at any dip as a potential buying opportunity, especially near the crucial $3200 level.SilverSilver has had yet another back and forth type of trading week, and it looks to me like traders are going to continue to look at this as a market that needs to work off some of the excess froth from the previous shot higher, with the $35.50 level offering significant support.

Breaking below that level opens up the possibility of a move down to the 18.5 MXN level, possibly even lower than that. However, we have recently seen a certain amount of negativity coming out of the US economy, which while you would think that would be very negative for the US dollar, the reality is that it has horrific effect on the Mexican economy as the Mexicans send roughly 85% of their exports into America.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewIn other words, the Mexicans have to worry about their biggest customer, and if they do in fact see the Americans slowing down into a recession, they will be buying as many Mexican goods.If we get to that situation, then a break above the 19.50 MXN level could be possible, and it could even open up a move to the 20 MXN level. However, I suspect that this would be more of a “shock to the system” type of more than anything else. If things stay somewhat stable over the next several weeks, then it’s likely that we will see the US dollar continue to suffer a little bit of negativity against the Mexican peso as the interest rate differential most certainly favors the Mexican peso over the US dollar.

The following press conference saw the Euro and Pound soar for an hour or two before falling back and giving up much of their earlier gains, so there seems to have been nothing from the ECB that caused a sustained change. Although the GBP/USD and EUR/USD price charts look quite bullish, the US Dollar Index chart is suggestive of a major bullish reversal (see below) so some caution here might be wise.The Bank of Canada left rates unchanged, so there was no surprise there, and the Loonie barely reacted to this meeting.Last week’s most important data releases were:US Non-Farm Payrolls and Average Hourly Earnings – NFP came in a bit above estimates, at 139k new jobs, while Average Hourly Earnings increased by 0.4% month-on-month, and that latter number is a high, key metric which the Fed watches.Eur",

However, all that changed in the early hours of Friday in the Middle East as news broke of a very strong Israeli strike on Iran’s key military figures and its nuclear materials and scientists. This sent markets into a risk-off direction.The Israeli strike has led to what could be described as all-out war between Israel and Iran, with Iran firing powerful ballistic missiles at Israeli population centers, and Israel in turn hitting hard at the military, the nuclear program, and increasingly at Iranian oil facilities.This war has been long awaited, and it seems clear that the Israeli attack was acquiesced in by the Americans, who so far at least are not helping with offensive actions, although they are likely assisting in Israel’s strong antimissile defense, which is continuing to intercept over 90% of projectiles. However, the missiles which get through cause serious damage and fatalities, although at a level the Israeli public can probably accept, at least for a few more days or weeks.It seems clear that the Iranian regime and nuclear program is in serious jeopardy, the nuclear program more so, and Iran has a limited supply of perhaps 2,000 ballistic missiles that it may not be able to replenish. The big question is whether the Americans will join in the drive to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, or whether Iran might sue for a negotiated settlement that would be acceptable to the USA.Th",

It looks very much like a victory for Israel and the USA.The USA claims that the strikes have been completely successful. The International Atomic Energy Agency has stated that it can find no increase in radiation levels from these facilities following the strikes.Al Jazeera is reporting that Iranian technicians spent the past three days removing materials from the key Fordow plant. Whether this is a significant development or not remains to be seen, but there is plenty of jubilation, or at least quiet relief, throughout the Middle East, Europea, and the USA today.The Iranian government is now also claiming that enriched uranium was removed from Fordow before the attack. One might consider that given the capabilities already demonstrated by Israel and the USA, that these countries are likely to have a good idea where it is now.Although the Iranian regime has issued blood-curling threats, pledging that no US citizen will be safe anywhere (a clear war crime if ever there was one, to add to its targeting of Israeli civilian buildings with cluster munitions last week), its response so far has been limited to a relatively small (45) missile barrage on Israel, which does not seem to have caused any fatalities.

Both Israel and the Trump administration have been quite belligerent, threatening to resume bombing if Iran acts to rebuild its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. The scale of the victory will certainly tilt the dynamics of the Middle East towards Israel and the USA, with the Trump administration hinting that further countries, possibly even including Syria, will shortly be joining the Abraham accords, i.e. making a formal peace with Israel.The aftermath of the war has seen risk assets, especially in the USA, increase in value, with major US stock market indices like the NASDAQ 100 and the S&P 500 breaking out to new all-time high prices, which is usually a very bullish sign.This bullish environment is interesting as it contradicts some economic data we got this week and what the Federal Reserve is saying, not to mention the 9th July Trump tariff deadline which is just around the corner.Jerome Powell, Chair of the Fed, has now led investors to expect three further rate cuts this year of 0.25% each, up from two.Final GDP data for the USA came in notably worse than expected, suggesting a recession might even be possible.Turning to the 9th July tariff deadline, the USA has concluded only two trade deals, meaning that if more deals are not inked over the next 10 days, the US will impose much higher tariffs on many countries.

As long as that’s going to be the case, I think you have a situation where there is a certain amount of uncertainty, but as things stand right now, this is simply a market that I think a lot of short-term traders are attracted to, mainly due to the fact that there is nothing really moving at the moment.Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewTechnical AnalysisThe technical analysis for this pair is very sideways, with the $65 level underneath offering support, and the $70 level above offering resistance.

We recently had seen a lot of volatility due to the war between the Israelis and the Iranians, but as that calmed down, we saw the market collapse right back into the $65 region, an area that previously had been resistance. This of course launched a certain amount of “market memory” to come into play, so it makes perfect sense that we have bounced from there a couple of times.If we were to break down below the $64 level, then I think the crude oil market is in trouble.

As previously mentioned, the EUR/USD pair will remain bullish due to selling pressure on the US dollar due to the US Federal Reserve's policy interventions, along with growing US financial concerns.In Europe, investors have been assessing a wave of inflation data from the region's largest economies and their implications for the European Central Bank's (ECB) policy path.

The Euro's gains intensified as investors assessed comments from European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers following the Eurozone's inflation rate reaching the ECB's 2% target.Speaking at the ECB Forum on Central Banking, ECB President Christine Lagarde welcomed the June inflation data, which came in as expected, but cautioned about \"two-sided risks\" stemming from increasing economic fragmentation and escalating geopolitical tensions. At the same time, other ECB officials indicated that interest rates are likely to remain stable at this month's meeting, after eight consecutive deposit rate cuts since June 2024.

The Euro's stability comes as investors await the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy decision and closely monitor trade developments between the EU and the United States.\nOn the monetary policy front, the European Central Bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged next Thursday after eight consecutive cuts, with policymakers adopting a wait-and-see approach amid uncertainty about the impact of higher-than-expected US tariffs and the strong Euro on European growth and inflation. Meanwhile, EU envoys are preparing to meet this week to discuss emergency measures in case no agreement is reached with US President Donald Trump, whose stance on tariffs appears to have hardened ahead of the August 1st deadline.\nThe technical forecasts for EUR/USD still indicate that the currency pair is moving within a counter-bearish channel, supported by its move below the 1.1600 support level. With the gains at the start of the week, the 14-day RSI (Relative Strength Index) has returned to around a reading of 56, moving away from the midline, which gives bulls renewed momentum to push higher.

This comes with a clear break from the pair's recent bearish reversal, which tested the 1.1556 support level last week. The currency pair's gains have been amplified by a breakthrough in resolving the US-EU trade dispute. Therefore, it is expected that a resolution to this \"war\" could deprive the Euro of the fuel needed to continue its ascent against the dollar. This is evident in mid-week currency price movements, as investors feel we are in the final phase of a rapid and turbulent period of global trade reordering orchestrated by US President Donald Trump. According to forex currency market trading, the Euro's price fell against all its G10 currency counterparts after Trump welcomed a new trade agreement with Japan, a country he had long accused of enjoying an unfair trade advantage over the United States.Details include a 15% tariff on Japanese imports, as well as various other measures by Japan to help boost imports from the United States.

At the start of the week's trading, the currency pair saw its largest daily decline in over two months, reaching its weakest level since June 20.Overall, the recent lower Euro trading reflects growing investor concern that the newly announced trade agreement between the United States and the European Union disproportionately benefits the US, doing little to improve the Eurozone's economic outlook. The agreement has drawn strong criticism from France, while others – including German Chancellor Merz – have emphasized the potential negative impact on European exporters and, consequently, on economic growth.

The Euro's losses came as investors cautiously await further clarity on upcoming US tariff measures. The European Union announced that it is making progress towards a trade agreement with the United States, aiming to prevent a significant escalation in tariffs through an initial agreement that would impose a comprehensive 10% tariff on many goods, with reduced rates for key sectors such as pharmaceuticals, alcohol, semiconductors, and commercial aircraft.However, the European Union also announced preparations for retaliatory tariffs on a range of US products in response to President Trump's metal tariffs. Officials warned that if an agreement is not reached, additional measures could follow, such as export controls and restrictions on US access to public contracts.

The gold price index closed the week stable around $3349 per ounce, amidst a bullish market momentum that could persist until August 1st, the date set by Trump for imposing more tariffs against global economies. The return of US dollar weakness and lower Treasury bond yields allowed the gold market to recover again.The decline in the US dollar and yields coincided with cautious statements from Federal Reserve Governor Waller last Thursday evening. His comments bolstered demand for precious metals as an inflation hedge, as he expressed support for US interest rate cuts at the FOMC meeting on July 29th and 30th. Precious metals markets also received support as a safe haven from global trade tensions, following President Trump's announcement last Wednesday of his intention to send tariff letters to over 150 countries, notifying them that tariff rates could be 10% or 15% starting August 1st.On the economic front, strong US economic news on Friday showed optimism regarding Federal Reserve policy, while limiting gains in precious metal prices.

Meanwhile, US and Chinese negotiators are scheduled to meet later today in an effort to extend the current trade truce and prevent new tariffs.Also, investors are focused on the Federal Reserve’s policy announcement scheduled for Wednesday, looking for clues on future US interest rate moves. Adding to the market’s cautious tone is a busy economic calendar featuring key US labor data such as nonfarm payrolls, ADP employment, and JOLTS job openings.

There is what I considered to be an “inner consolidation area” between the $3300 level and the $3400 level. So, in other words, I think there are plenty of places to see a lot of noise and choppiness, and unless we put some external pressure on this market, we may very well just jump back and forth in the same range for the month. I am bullish in general, but I also recognize that we need some type of momentum to get things moving.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewAll things being equal, I do believe that eventually we could break out to the upside, but I don’t know if it will be during the month of August. If it is, then it probably means that the US dollar is falling, or perhaps there is a major “risk off” move in the markets, and gold will be used to protect wealth. I do recognize that we have been in a long-term uptrend for some time, at least until the last couple of months. This consolidation area lines up perfectly with the old adage of “sell in May and go away” that Wall Street quite often will quote. Perhaps that’s all there is, but if we were to break down below the $3000 level, then I think you’ve got a situation where gold really starts to crumble.

The market is very strong, but we also gave back quite a bit of the gains late in the week, so I think this is a situation where you probably look for dips to continue buying copper from a longer-term standpoint with particular interest paid to the $5.50 level, and then the $5.20 level.SilverSilver initially rallied during the week but got absolutely clobbered near the $40 level. The resulting candlestick is a very ugly shooting star, but it’s worth noting that the previous 2 candlesticks were a large, explosive, positive candlestick, followed by a hammer. In other words, there is a lot of noise in this area, and I think you continue to see a lot of back and forth trading more than anything else. With that being the case, the market is just simply trying to sort out whether or not we have enough momentum to go higher. I would not be looking to short this market.Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewGoldGold markets rallied a bit during the week to reach just below the $3500 level but got clobbered as we have seen an absolute hammering of price.

Somewhere in that general vicinity, I would love to see a pullback, followed by a bounce that I can start buying. That being said, if we break down below the $6000 level, then things might be changing. However, I suspect that you will know that some type of external pressure is being applied to the market, and therefore you can just simply trade according to the overall risk appetite sentiment.However, the market bouncing the way it has from the beginning of April suggest that there are plenty of buyers out there willing to get involved, even if we are a little overdone. To the upside, I would anticipate that the $6500 level could be a bit of a target, and if we can break above there then I think buyers will jump in and try to take advantage of the overall uptrend. I have no interest in shorting the market, at least not until we break down below the $6000 level, and even then, I would need to have an actual reason. We could have a bit of a “zombie rally” going through the month, meaning that we just simply drift higher in a very slow and methodical manner.Ready to trade our monthly forecast?

President Trump has stated India faces a tariff of 25% if it does not bend its trade policy.

Via Trump’s public messages yesterday on social media, the White House made it clear that the tariff stance is not only about trade between the U.S and India, but also India’s energy policy with Russia that is not seen favorably by the Trump administration. India is a large buyer of Russian energy and this will be hard to change.The tactic of scolding India publicly about its energy policy will not be warmly received in India and could cause Prime Minister Modi to make a public stance that is uncomfortable.

I don’t think that changes anytime soon, but a little bit of a bounce would make a certain amount of sense. The 19 MXN level above is a significant area due to the large, round, psychologically significant figure in and of itself, and of course the 200 Week EMA is sitting right there as well. Ultimately, this is a scenario where market participants continue to look at this through the prism of the interest rate differential favoring Mexico, and of course the fact that the Mexican peso tends to do fairly well when the US economy does.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewKeep in mind that Mexico is the largest exporter to the United States, so if the US economy continues to be very strong, that almost certainly will help the Mexican economy as so much of its goods end up in the United States. With that being said, I think that we may get a little bit of a bounce, but I’m still looking to play short-term rallies to show signs of exhaustion, opening up an assault and attack on the 18.50 MXN level underneath, where we have of course found the little bit of support.Ready to trade our monthly forecast?

The bill had looked in danger, but it was eventually pushed through both Houses of Congress. This is a win for President Trump, although the bill has been criticized as fiscally irresponsible by many on the right.Sentiment was certainly boosted by the much stronger jobs and average hourly earnings data released in the USA on Thursday, which sent stock markets soaring as the data showed a much stronger than expected economy.Although sentiment was risk-on last week, the sentiment is showing signs of slowing, and this is probably because Trump’s tariffs are now starting to come back into focus, with the coming Wednesday 9th July being Trump’s deadline for trade deals or higher tariffs, although President Trump has indicated he might extend the deadline again for at least some countries.It does seem likely that President Trump will announce the exact rates of steeper tariffs which will start to apply Wednesday from early next week, and where there are no deal or bad deals, we could see some volatility in the stock markets and currencies of those countries, as we did earlier in 2025 when Trump’s higher tariffs first started being imposed..Other market drivers last week related to certain high-impact data releases:US Average Hourly Earnings – this was expected to show a lower month-on-month increase of only 0",

However, once the story leaked, Trump issued a statement saying it was “highly unlikely” Powell would be removed without a cause of misconduct. Trump is angry that Powell and the Fed are being very slow to cut the relatively high interest rate of 4.25% / 4.50%, which Trump sees as holding back economic growth and probably the stock market too, which in any case is already advancing to record highs.The Powell story initially hit the US Dollar, but once it was denied the Dollar turned around and enjoyed yet another week of advances.Other market drivers last week related to certain high-impact data releases, and helped send major US stock market indices to new record highs:US CPI (inflation) – the data was conflicted, as the annualized rate rose a little more than expected, to 2.7%, but Core",

Today’s price has moved between $839 and $865, with intraday dips quickly met by buyers.This stability follows a period of heavy accumulation by larger players. Notably, CEA Industries purchased 200,000 BNB this month, adding to bullish sentiment.That buying activity has reinforced the $830–$835 zone as a critical line of defense for bulls, which turns it into a key support area.The wider crypto market is providing a supportive backdrop. Bitcoin is consolidating above $121,000, and Ethereum is steady near $4,741. The absence of sharp pullbacks in majors is allowing BNB to maintain momentum without facing aggressive profit-taking pressure.$830 Support and $865 Resistance Define the Current RangeThe immediate support for BNB now sits in the $830–$835 band. This range has already absorbed several profit-taking events this week, proving its importance for short-term stability.If price breaks below this level, the next area of interest is $802–$805, a pivot zone marked by prior consolidation.Resistance is building at $860–$865.

Since hitting a record high above $123,000 on July 14, Bitcoin (BTC) entered a period of consolidation, largely holding above $118,000, before world events helped bears drive the price of King Crypto to a low of $111,940 on August 3.Since then, bulls have taken control, stair-stepping BTC back above $119,000 to hit a high of $122,290 on Monday, and are looking poised to push into uncharted territory.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewAiding bulls in their efforts was the Tuesday release of the July US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which showed inflation holding at 2.7% year-over-year, unchanged from June and below the 2.8% forecast.The boost in Bitcoin’s price comes as market watchers continue to increase their expectations for a September Fed interest rate cut, with the CME FedWatch tool indicating a 94.2% probability of a 25-basis-point cut. While the CPI data shows that inflation remains above the Fed’s target rate of 2%, many hope that the improvement thus far will convince them to lower rates and ease financial pressures.Cryptos also saw a spike in prices and trading volume after U.S. President Donald Trump directed financial regulators to expand access to alternative investments in 401(k) plans, including digital assets and privately owned companies.According to market analyst Merlijn The Trader, the ensuing recovery marked the end of Bitcoin accumulation, and up next comes the face-melting parabolic phase.Bitcoin Accumulation is over.

It is now settling around 1.1700 at the start of Thursday's session, awaiting further positive momentum to close the week on a high note. According to reliable trading platforms, the euro's gains have increased as the US dollar weakened to its lowest level since late July. This was driven by US inflation data, which strengthened expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, boosting global risk appetite.On the European side, the European Central Bank (ECB) ended its monetary easing cycle in July after eight cuts over the past year, leaving borrowing costs at their lowest since November 2022. Some analysts, however, still see the possibility of another cut before the end of the year.

Following the start of the Trump-Putin summit late last week, the EUR/USD pair recovered to the 1.1715 resistance level, close to its highest point in two weeks. Forecasters expect the euro to benefit if US President Donald Trump is able to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.The foreign exchange market's focus is on the meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where a significant breakthrough on a ceasefire is hoped for. A ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine would be a crucial turning point, as it could significantly strengthen the euro by boosting economic activity in the Eurozone through lower energy prices and improved consumer and business confidence. However, this is not a core expectation.It's unrealistic to expect a deal on Friday, but there's a strong possibility that it could pave the way for an eventual end to the conflict. According to performance across trusted trading platforms, with the euro rising by 12.75% against the US dollar by 2025, further gains are possible if geopolitical risks centered on Europe's eastern flank dissipate.Resolving the Ukraine Crisis Will Strengthen the EuroRussia's invasion of Ukraine marked a turning point for the European economy, which was highly dependent on Russian hydrocarbons.

The precious metal has now risen in six of the last nine trading sessions. According to data from gold trading platforms, the gold price index rose to the $3370 resistance level before settling around $3355 per ounce at the time of writing. Buying interest in gold increased after US Treasury Secretary Scott Biesent's comments supporting a half-point interest rate cut in September.Conversely, the latest US Consumer Price Index data showed core inflation rising more than 3% year-on-year. Accordingly, analysts suggest that the US inflation target of 2% is no longer the focus of the Federal Reserve.Upcoming Technical Levels for GoldBased on the daily chart and analyst forecasts, gold's bullish trend remains supported as long as it holds above the $3300 resistance level. If the current upward momentum continues, the bulls may find opportunities to advance toward resistance levels at $3378, $3385, and then the psychological level of $3400 per ounce, which would strengthen their control over the trend. The recent rally hasn't significantly moved the 14-day RSI from its midpoint, and the MACD indicator remains in neutral territory.Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewAs we mentioned earlier, the $3,400 resistance level will remain an important indicator of bullish control over gold. Conversely, the success of the gold downside scenario over this period will depend on a successful break of the $3,300",

This marks a recovery from a two-week low of around $3324. Recently, the gold price index is recovering as investors anticipate the meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss a peace deal with Russia. Zelensky will be joined by prominent European leaders when he meets with Trump later today.This follows a highly anticipated summit last Friday between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which failed to produce any breakthrough on a ceasefire. However, Putin did agree to allow the US and Europe to provide strong security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a final agreement to end the war.Meanwhile, financial markets will closely monitor Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's remarks at the Jackson Hole Symposium, as well as the minutes of the Fed's latest meeting, amid growing expectations of an interest rate cut in September.Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewTechnical indicators await further upward momentum.According to the daily chart and gold analysts, the technical indicators are awaiting stronger factors to turn bullish.

    "content": "SilverSilver markets spent most of the week selling off, as we have seen a lot of volatility around the world. At this point, it’s worth noting that the US dollar sold off a bit but held firm against certain currencies. In other words, it looks like the volatility is only somewhat justified, and I think at this point in time it’s worth noting that the $36 level seems to be a significant support level just waiting to happen. If we can recapture the $37.50 level, we will probably reenter the range that we had been in during the previous month.GBP/USDThe British pound has plunged for most of the week, testing the crucial 1.32 region. However, we have found a little bit of support at the end of the week as the jobs number in the United States was horrible. This has the US dollar on the back foot just a little bit, but quite frankly, it has held its own fairly well, all things being considered. If we break down below the 50 Week EMA at the 1.3063 region, I suspect that the British pound will start to fall apart. If the British pound falls apart against the US dollar, the greenback probably swallows everything else right along with it.EUR/USDThe euro dropped fairly significantly during the course of the week to peek below the 1.15 level for a while but did recover a bit after the Non-Farm Payroll number came out of the United States much weaker than anticipated. This is an ugly candlestick regardless, so I do think this is a situation where if we get any follow-through whatsoever, namely a breakdown below the bottom of the weekly candlestick from the one that we just printed, the euro could be in serious trouble at that point. On the other hand, if we recapture the 1.16 level, then it’s likely that this pair will look likely to reach the 1.18 level eventually.Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewBitcoinBitcoin has had a tough week, but quite frankly Bitcoin had been a little stretched.

The primary customers of defense stocks are governments, which bring steady, long-term contracts, deep pockets, and a history of paying their bills on time. Pledges by NATO countries to boost defense spending provide a tailwind for earnings in the years ahead. Do you know what to look for in defense stocks?What Are War Stocks?War stocks, also known as defense stocks, refer to publicly listed companies that are actively engaged in the aerospace, space, and defense sectors. They form the backbone of defending sovereign countries and territories. Analysts expect demand to surge over the next decade, with global conflicts and geopolitical tensions rising.Why Should You Consider Investing in Defense Stocks?Defense stocks provide long-term, reliable income streams for companies. They outperform during market corrections and bear markets, as short-term economic cycles have a minimal impact on their business model.Despite popular opinion, conflicts do not move the price of defense stocks. There will be a short-term bounce, which usually falters. Investors must understand the long-term nature of defense stocks, where research and development (R&D) remain crucial. Conflicts boost demand for replenishing stockpiles and hardware, create opportunities to test new weapons platforms, and attract future buyers. Still, R&D and cybersecurity services are where defense stocks receive their best margins.Here are a few things to consider when evaluating defense stocks:The defense sector is seeking green alternatives, and stocks with a lead in sustainability could outperform peersFocus on defense stocks with excellent R&D capabilitiesCommunications, electronic warfare, and cybersecurity defense stocks provide ongoing revenue and have excellent growth ratesDefense stocks active in drone and anti-drone warfare rank among the fast",

While Brazil’s ruling government remains locked in a stubborn debate with the U.S White House, financial institutions apparently aren’t all that concerned. The USD/BRL is traversing long-term lows and is trading in a healthy correlation to other major currency pairs.While the USD/BRL traded around the 5.4000 ratio in early July, yesterday’s values however dropped below those early July marks when the 5.3800 level got some attention briefly. There isn’t a great amount of trading volume in the USD/BRL. The currency pair has not demonstrated a serious reversal higher over the past month, showing that financial institutions are comfortable within the lower values for the USD/BRL, spikes higher have been infrequent even with low volumes.Sustained Lows and Speculation in the USD/BRLThe ability of the USD/BRL to sustain lower price action and its trend downwards will prove intriguing to speculators. The USD/BRL doesn’t offer a great amount of price velocity, but traders who have patience and use conservative leverage may have an opportunity to pursue the currency pair with better odds.Top Forex Brokers1  Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewYesterday’s weaker than anticipated CPI year on year number from the U.S helped create more impetus for a weaker USD. The U.S Federal Reserve is now being called upon by analysts to lower the Federal Funds Rate in September, and it is likely the Fed will cut by at least 0.25 basis points.

This did not set up.The small overall loss of 5.60% equals a loss of 0.80% per asset.The news last week was dominated by the US Federal Reserve’s policy meeting, which produced a hawkish tilt. Although the Federal Funds Rate was maintained at 4.50% as was almost universally expected, comments and forecasts made by Jerome Powell and the FOMC sharply reduced expectations of a 0.25% rate cut at the next meeting in September. Stronger than expected Advance GDP data helped fuel this more hawkish narrative, but Friday’s weaker than expected jobs data when Non-Farm Payrolls were released completely reversed the situation and led to stock markets and other risky assets falling sharply. According to the CME’s FedWatch tool, the chance of a 0.25% rate cut in September now stands as high as 80%.The central bank policy meetings in Japan and Canada were of little consequence.There was more volatility than has been usual over recent weeks. The Forex market saw it especially in the Japanese Yen and in the Antipodean currencies (AUD, NZD).Fears of a faltering US economy and a Fed that may have kept interest rates too high for too long will likely translate into risk-off sentiment as this week opens later.A summary of last week’s most important data:US Federal Funds Rate and FOMC Statement – the Federal Funds rate was unchanged,",
