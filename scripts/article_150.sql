    'SilverSilver has been very bullish during the past week, but as you can see from the weekly chart, the market continues to bounce around $35 on the bottom and the $37.50 level above. All things being equal, this is a market that continues to be very noisy, and I think this is a situation where we are very bullish overall, but short-term pullbacks will continue to attract a certain amount of attention any time he gets close to the $35 level. If we can break above the $37.50 level, then we could open up a move to the $40 level.GoldThe gold market has been slightly bullish during the trading week, but much like the silver market, we find ourselves in a fairly tight range of $300. The $3200 level underneath is a significant amount of support just waiting to happen, and the $3500 level above is a significant barrier. All things being equal, if we can break above the $3500 level, then we could go looking to the $3800 level. Ultimately, gold continues to see plenty of buyers on dips, and I fully anticipate that over the next several weeks we will continue to go higher in general.Crude OilThe light oil market crude oil market has bounce just a bit during the course of the week as we continue to hang around the $65 level. All things being equal, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of volatility, but rallying from here to reach the $80 level is what I fully anticipate as we are heading into the busiest time for demand in the crude oil market. Short-term pullbacks at this point in time is likely to attract plenty of buying opportunity.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewBitcoinBitcoin has gone back and forth during the week as we continue to see a certain amount of upward pressure over the longer term, with the $110,000 level being a major barrier. If we can break above that level, then itâ€™s likely that we could go looking to the $120,000 level. Short-term pullbacks will continue to attract value hunters underneath,',
