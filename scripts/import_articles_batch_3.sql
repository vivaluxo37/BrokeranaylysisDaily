Negotiations will be ongoing until the 90-day period ends in early July.The major event of last week, which had a very light news agenda, was President Trump’s attempt at a gentle walk back of his comments blasting Jerome Powell of the Federal Reserve for not cutting rates more aggressively, which had led to a sharp fall in stock markets the previous week. Trump’s comments may have aided the recovery we saw in stock markets and in other risky assets last week.Last week’s other major data points were:Flash Services & Manufacturing PMI UA, Germany, UK, France – mostly worse than expected, suggested slowing economies.Chair of Swiss National Bank SpeechCanada Retail Sales – as expected.US Unemployment Claims – as expected.UK Retail Sales – this was much better than expected, showing a 0.4% month-on-month increase, when a decline of 0.3% was anticipated.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe Week Ahead: 28th April – 2nd MayThe coming week has a busy schedule of important releases, including key US economic data and a policy meeting at the Bank of Japan.This week’s important data points, in order of likely importance, are:US Core PCE Price IndexUS Average Hourly EarningsUS Non-Farm Employment ChangeGerman Preliminary CPIAustralian CPI (inflation)US Advance GDPBank of Japan Policy Rate, Monetary Policy Statement, and Outlook ReportCanadian GDPCanadian',

    'USD/CADThe US dollar has plummeted against the Canadian dollar during trading this past week, as we are now testing the crucial 1.3750 level. The 1.3750 level is an area that is very important, and at this point in time, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of volatility and potential support, but at this point, I would need to see the US dollar recapture the 1.39 level to begin to think about buying against the Canadian dollar, despite the fact that there is still no trade agreement between the 2 economies.Crude OilThe crude oil markets have been all over the place during the week, as we tested the $65 level but then turned around to show signs of hesitation. The $60 level seems to be offering support, and if we can stay above that level, then I think you’ve got a real opportunity to go back and forth on short-term chart. I think that’s probably the most likely turn of events, but Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs being recommended against the European Union starting June 1, and that could be negative for oil, only time will tell. If we can recapture the $65 level on a daily close, then I think crude oil can rally quite nicely.USD/JPYThe US dollar fell rather significantly during the trading week against the Japanese yen, and now that we have more chaos involving tariffs, it’s possible that we could see the Japanese yen continue to strengthen. This flies in the face of the interest rate situation, and at this point in time I am fairly neutral about this pair. I believe there is a ton of support between current levels in the ¥140 level, so I am looking for stability and a turnaround to start buying. If we were to break down below the ¥140 level, that would be extraordinarily negative.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThis might be one of the more interesting pears this week, as the United States and the European Union are about to ratchet up tensions as far as tariffs are concerned.

    'GoldGold markets obviously have been at the forefront of everybody’s thought process lately, and this last week would have been no different. With that being said, it’s probably worth noting that we are seeing hesitation above the $3.400 level for the 3rd week in a row. This doesn’t necessarily mean that gold is going to fall apart, but I do think we have some work to do to get moving. That being said, you should also keep in mind that the US and Chinese delegates meet this weekend.GBP/USDThis is one of the most interesting charts for me on the weekly timeframe in the world of forex. Quite frankly, we are struggling mightily to break above the 1.34 level, and the fact that we are finishing the week with a candlestick that looks a lot like a shooting star, and preceded by 2 actual shooting stars, tells me that we are on the precipice of a potential strengthening of the US dollar. By contrast, if we can break above the 1.35 level, the British pound could soar at that point, perhaps picking up another 500 pips. Nonetheless, it’s worth noting that there are several charts starting to hint that the US dollar is potentially going to make a comeback.USD/CADThis is one of those charges I was speaking about. The engulfing candlestick on the weekly chart suggest that buyers have stepped in and started buying the greenback against the Canadian dollar in mass. This makes sense, as Canada still does not have a trade deal with its most important trading partner, the United States. By extension, this means that the Canadian economy is going to remain under pressure, and therefore I think we will see the greenback continue higher.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThis is an interesting chart as well, as we have seen market participants go in both directions all week, as we tested the 1.12 level at the very lows, but have since bounced quite nicely.

    'DAXThe German index initially tried to take off to the upside on Monday, as we gapped higher, only to turn around and fill the gap. That being said, the €23,500 level looks to be a significant support level as we have bounced nicely from there, and ultimately, I think we have a situation where the market has recently broken above significant resistance, and it’s likely that we will continue to see buyers on each and every dip. I suspect at this point the DAX will go looking to the €25,000 level.USD/JPYThe US dollar initially fell during the week against the Japanese yen, but the ¥145 level has offered support. All things being equal, this is a market that continues to see a lot of volatility, but there are a lot of buyers underneath that will continue to come into the market and choose the US dollar due to the interest rate differential, as the Bank of Japan has absolutely no real chance of tightening anytime soon. Meanwhile, bonds are selling off in the United States, driving yields higher.GoldGold has had a tough week, but it looks as if we are closing just below the crucial $3200 level. The $3200 level of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area that a lot of people would be watching very closely. After all, it has served as support and resistance multiple times, and of course we are in the middle of a massive rally overall. With this being the case, I do suspect that if we can recapture the $3200 level, then it is possible that the gold market starts reaching toward the upside yet again.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewBitcoinBitcoin has a pretty choppy week but ultimately ended up settling on a fairly unchanged turn of events. All things being equal, this is a market that continues to find buyers on dips, and therefore I suspect it is probably only a matter of time before we break out above the crucial $106,000 level, allowing us to take a serious look at breaking above the $110,00',

    'WTI/CL CrudeThe West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil market fell pretty significantly during the trading week, as we are looking to close below the $60 level. This is an area that I think attracts a lot of attention, mainly due to the fact that we had bounced so significantly from there previously. That being said, the market is closing below the $60 level, so we do need to be somewhat cautious at this point in time. All things being equal, this is a market that I think will continue to see a lot of volatility as traders are worried about demand. Ultimately, this is a sideways market at the moment, leading to the downside.GoldThe gold market initially tried to rally for the week but then fell rather hard. It’s interesting to see that the gold market is falling while the stock market is rallying. We have had a major negative correlation between gold and stocks as of late, so I’m paying close attention to the $3200 level, and then again, I would be watching at the $3000 level for some type of bounce that I can start buying again.AUD/USDThe Australian dollar has a positive week, as we are now breaking above the 50 Week EMA. By doing so, the market looks as if it is ready to continue going higher, perhaps looking to the 200 Week EMA near the 0.67 level. Ultimately, this is a market that is probably getting some benefit from the idea of China quietly looking for a trade deal with the United States, which would have a major influence on the Australian economy as they are a major supplier of raw materials for China and of course the overall economic engine that drives the rest of the world as far as manufacturing is concerned.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThe euro has been all over the place during the course of the week, as we continue to look for some type of directionality.

    'While Bitcoin volatility remains elevated, the flagship cryptocurrency has formed a classic bullish continuation pattern backed by high network growth and optimism around the second round of US-China trade talks.US-China Trade Talks Raise Hopes for Market CalmFresh US-China trade talks, which kicked off in London on Monday, Junce 9, 2025, have sparked optimism for de-escalating tensions, boosting global market sentiment. The talks, involving key officials like US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, aim to reduce tariffs, previously 145% on Chinese goods and 125% on US exports—that have disrupted supply chains and raised recession fears.A potential deal could stabilize equities, increase risk appetite, and drive capital into assets like Bitcoin, seen as a hedge against economic uncertainty.Reduced tariffs could also weaken the US dollar, enhancing Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value. Additionally, positive trade outcomes may counter inflationary pressures from upcoming CPI data, reducing fears of tighter Federal Reserve policies that could dampen crypto markets.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May is due for reading on Wednesday, June 11, with markets fearing that a negative outcome of the US-China talks could add pressure on market prices.Market analysts project the US CPI to rise 0.3% month-over-month and 2.3% year-over-year.

The market finding a bit of sideways action in that region makes a certain amount of sense because of the “market memory”, but I also believe that crude oil was trying to break out to the upside before conflict broke out between Iran and Israel. That ended up being the catalyst to really get things moving, but now that we are back where we started, I think they are looking to recover a bit in the month of July.This doesn’t necessarily mean that we take off to the stratosphere, but I think what it means is that the market is going to continue to grind higher more than anything else. Cyclically speaking, this is typically a very positive time of year for crude oil, and unless we get some type of external shock over the next month, it’s likely that we will start to focus on that again. After all, demand picks up in the United States, as well as the European Union during the summer, all things being equal. I am bullish, but I also expected to be a very choppy and slow grind higher.Ready to trade mon',

    'Ethereum Analyst Projects $10K ETH in 2025: Here’s Why',
    'Ether (ETH) rallied approximately 20% from six-week lows at $2,100 on June 22 to a high of $2,526 on June 29. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 9% over the last week and 35% over the last 90 days.With a market capitalization of $298 billion, Ether cements its position as the second most valuable cryptocurrency, according to the CoinMarketCap ranking.Apart from the uptrend in the wider crypto market fueled by increased inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs and Bitcoin’s rally to $108,000 over the weekend, other fundamental factors and onchain metrics back Ethereum’s potential to follow in BTC’s footsteps to reach new all-time highs and possibly top out at $10,000 in 2025.Dwindling Exchange SupplyOne factor supporting Ether’s upside is reducing supply on exchanges. Data from onchain market intelligence firm Glassnode shows Ether’s reserve on exchanges reached a nine-year low of 16.15 million ETH on June 23, after dropping 10% over the last 90 days.ETH Exchange Supply. Source: GlassnodeThe total balance between inflows and outflows in and out of all known exchange wallets shows a steep decline since October 2023, when withdrawals from the crypto trading platforms began to surge. This drop accompanies a 130% rise in ETH price over the same period.Decreasing ETH supply on exchanges simply means investors could be withdrawing their tokens into self-custody wallets. This indicates a lack of intention to sell in anticipation of a price increase in the future.This is explained by a spike in accumulation by large holders over the last few weeks. More data from Glassnode shows that wallets holding $100,000 and $1 million or more worth of ETH have been on the rise since the start of April.Number of ETH Wallets with Balances > $100K and $1M. Source: GlassnodeThe chart above shows that wallets holding $100,000 or more have increased from 58,565 on April 8 to 93,000 on June 29.

Gains extended to the 1.1641 resistance level at the time of writing, marking the pair''s highest point since 2021. The Euro''s gains increased amid the US dollar''s weak performance as traders continue to assess the situation in the Middle East. Recently, US President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which eased concerns about potential supply disruptions in the energy sector. However, the truce is being tested as Israel has already accused Iran of violating the agreement.On the economic front, business sentiment in Germany improved, according to the Ifo Index, reaching its highest level in almost a year. However, preliminary PMI indicators painted a mixed picture, with private sector activity in the Eurozone showing signs of stabilization. Meanwhile, concerning monetary policy, analysts still expect a 25-basis-point interest rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB) before the end of the year. For her part, ECB Governor Lagarde stated that "at current interest rate levels, we believe we are well-positioned to navigate uncertain conditions," while Governing Council member Villeroy de Galhau said the ECB could still cut rates in the first half of next year.Trading Advice:Despite the gains, we still advise selling the Euro against the US Dollar from every upward level, but without taking risks, while closely monitoring f',

Tehran and Tel Aviv had agreed to a temporary ceasefire after exchanging strikes since last week. However, reports of fresh missile launch, and strike orders raised scepticism about the truce''s validity and fuelled concerns that the conflict would soon resume.Furthermore, this occurred after the exchange of controlled strikes between Iran and the United States minimized collateral damage and preceded a period of apparent de-escalation.

That being said, the market has pulled back just a bit, but I think we still see plenty of support near the ¥142 level, and I do think that we might be in the midst of a bottoming pattern. Furthermore, we are starting to see the US dollar stiffen it’s resolve against the basket of major currencies that we typically followed.

We are currently in the middle of a lot of choppy behavior, and I think we have a situation where market participants will have to look at this from a short-term perspective more than anything else, as we look like we are trying to find a reason to continue the overall uptrend but just do not have it at the moment.WTI Crude OilThe WTI Crude Oil market had a very strong week, breaking toward the crucial $65 level. The market breaking above the $65 level is a very positive sign, so I will be watching that this week. A move above could open up a move to the $68 level, possibly even the $72.50 level. Underneath, we have a massive amount of support near the $60 level, so as long as we can stay above there, I still think there are plenty of buyers in this market as the US economy is stronger than the market had been pricing in previously, if the jobs numbers are to be believed.NASDAQ 100The NASDAQ 100 rallied for the week, breaking above the 21,800 level, and threatening overall highs near 42,100.

    'EUR/USDThe euro rallied a bit during the trading week, breaking above the 1.16 level, but we have given back some of the gains after the Israeli airstrikes on the Iranian regime. This of course has people running toward safety currency such as the US dollar, so it does make sense that we have seen hesitation. However, earlier in the week we had seen quite a bit of bullish pressure, so one would have to assume that there is at least some demand out there for the euro. I suspect the next couple of weeks will be very violent but may have a bit of a bid for them.USD/MXNThe US dollar spent most of the week falling against the Mexican peso, but turned around after the airstrikes, and because of this we are sitting right at the 200 Week EMA. We are also at the crucial 19 MXN level, so if we were to bounce from here it would make a certain amount of sense, but I see a lot of resistance near the 19.40 MXN level, so whether or not it is going to truly rally remains to be seen, I think that could be an area where we could see some issue. A break above the 50 Week EMA could send this pair to the 20 MXN level.GBP/USDThe British pound has been all over the place during the week, as we continue to see a lot of questions asked of the US dollar. That being said, after the airstrikes on Friday, we have seen a little bit of a pushback against risk-taking, so it’ll be interesting to see how this plays out. Ultimately, I think we have a scenario where traders will be looking at this through the prism of risk appetite, and right now we are currently trading in a range between the 1.34 level on the bottom and the 1.3650 level on the top.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewAUD/USDThe Australian dollar traders have seen the market go back and forth during the course of the week as we continue to watch the 0.6550 level as a massive barrier.

    'CL/WTIThe Light Sweet Crude Oil market fell rather hard during the course of the week, as the Iranians and Israelis signed a cease-fire. This of course has taken some of the “risk premium” out of the market for crude oil, as tensions in the Middle East seem to be slowing down a bit. Because of this, I think you have a situation where traders simply got rid of those “panic longs”, as we had gotten far too ahead of ourselves. With this being the case, range bound trading is more likely than not going to be where we go from here.GoldGold markets have fallen rather significantly during the course of the week, and I think what we have is a situation where a lot of the “risk premium” coming out of the gold trade has had a major influence. That being said, now that the situation in the Middle East has calmed down, I think we will focus on things like central bank buying, the idea that the Federal Reserve is going to cut later this year, and of course the overall momentum trade. Because of this, traders will more likely than not look at any dip as a potential buying opportunity, especially near the crucial $3200 level.SilverSilver has had yet another back and forth type of trading week, and it looks to me like traders are going to continue to look at this as a market that needs to work off some of the excess froth from the previous shot higher, with the $35.50 level offering significant support. If we were to break to the upside, pay close attention to the $37.50 level, because it is an area that could offer support going forward as it is now resistant. Any move above opens up the possibility of $40. At this point, I look at this is a market that is likely to either go sideways or break out to the upside.

    'As I write this analysis, the US dollar is barely hanging on against the Mexican peso, and it is probably worth noting that the US dollar is struggling against multiple other currencies.The Mexican peso is a bit of a different animal though, because the 2 economies are so heavily intertwined that the reaction in the pair could be quite a bit different than most people anticipate occasionally.Technical AnalysisTop Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewLooking at the technical analysis, it’s worth noting that we are breaking toward the 18.80 MXN level, which is an area that’s been supported for a couple of weeks. Breaking below that level opens up the possibility of a move down to the 18.5 MXN level, possibly even lower than that. However, we have recently seen a certain amount of negativity coming out of the US economy, which while you would think that would be very negative for the US dollar, the reality is that it has horrific effect on the Mexican economy as the Mexicans send roughly 85% of their exports into America.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewIn other words, the Mexicans have to worry about their biggest customer, and if they do in fact see the Americans slowing down into a recession, they will be buying as many Mexican goods.If we get to that situation, then a break above the 19.50 MXN level could be possible, and it could even open up a move to the 20 MXN level. However, I suspect that this would be more of a “shock to the system” type of more than anything else. If things stay somewhat stable over the next several weeks, then it’s likely that we will see the US dollar continue to suffer a little bit of negativity against the Mexican peso as the interest rate differential most certainly favors the Mexican peso over the US dollar. The last couple of months have been negative, and unless something shocks the system, it’s very likely that we could see a little bit of continuation in this trend.Ready to trade our monthly forec',

However, all that changed in the early hours of Friday in the Middle East as news broke of a very strong Israeli strike on Iran’s key military figures and its nuclear materials and scientists. This sent markets into a risk-off direction.The Israeli strike has led to what could be described as all-out war between Israel and Iran, with Iran firing powerful ballistic missiles at Israeli population centers, and Israel in turn hitting hard at the military, the nuclear program, and increasingly at Iranian oil facilities.This war has been long awaited, and it seems clear that the Israeli attack was acquiesced in by the Americans, who so far at least are not helping with offensive actions, although they are likely assisting in Israel’s strong antimissile defense, which is continuing to intercept over 90% of projectiles. However, the missiles which get through cause serious damage and fatalities, although at a level the Israeli public can probably accept, at least for a few more days or weeks.It seems clear that the Iranian regime and nuclear program is in serious jeopardy, the nuclear program more so, and Iran has a limited supply of perhaps 2,000 ballistic missiles that it may not be able to replenish. The big question is whether the Americans will join in the drive to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, or whether Iran might sue for a negotiated settlement that would be acceptable to the USA.Th',

One might consider that given the capabilities already demonstrated by Israel and the USA, that these countries are likely to have a good idea where it is now.Although the Iranian regime has issued blood-curling threats, pledging that no US citizen will be safe anywhere (a clear war crime if ever there was one, to add to its targeting of Israeli civilian buildings with cluster munitions last week), its response so far has been limited to a relatively small (45) missile barrage on Israel, which does not seem to have caused any fatalities.

This of course launched a certain amount of “market memory” to come into play, so it makes perfect sense that we have bounced from there a couple of times.If we were to break down below the $64 level, then I think the crude oil market is in trouble. Conversely, if we were to break above the $70 level, then it’s likely that the crude oil market launches toward the $73 level, where we currently find the',

    'Ethereum Price Rallies 30% During ‘Crypto Week’',
    'Ether (ETH) price rallied toward $4,000 at the week-open on Monday, a level not seen since December 2024, fuelled by hopes of increasing crypto regulatory clarity and persistent spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows.The largest altcoin by market capitalization is up more than 30% in the last seven days and 56% month-to-date, to hit a 7-month high at $3,825 on Bitstamp on July 21. Its trading volume has jumped 66% to $8 billion over the last 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the demand side activity.Ethereum''s performance comes on the heels of a busy “Crypto Week” in the US and is backed by increasing network activity and persistent spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows.Favorable Regulatory Action Boosts ETH PriceThe recent surge in Ethereum’s price, which saw it climb to within a hair''s breadth of $4,000, has been significantly influenced by the US "Crypto Week," a period marked by heightened legislative and market activity surrounding cryptocurrencies.Last week saw three key pieces of crypto legislation passed by the US House of Representatives, with the GENIUS Act set to establish a federal framework for stablecoins. This has sparked optimism across the crypto market, with Ethereum leading the charge among altcoins.Posts on X and web reports highlight a confluence of factors, including a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment anticipated under a new administration.For instance, the Financial Times reported that US President Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order allowing 401(k) accounts to invest in cryptocurrencies, signalling a shift toward mainstream acceptance.Ethereum breaks out with strongest rally in weeks, outpacing BTC and Solana as “global stablecoin adoption prompts central banks to fast-track crypto frameworks,” said a crypto investor Azeezaht Adeola in a July 17 post on X, adding:“Crypto Week heats up as the US House greenlights final votes on big crypto laws.”This legislative momentum has bolstered invest',

    'ETH/USD Monthly Forecast: August 2025 (Chart)',
    'The gains in ETH/USD accomplished the past two and half weeks have been astounding. Ethereum began trading in July around the 2,300.00 ratio, on the 8th of July ETH/USD had gained but in a very polite fashion as it dabbled with the 2,600.00 level. That is not a bad gain for any asset. However, as of this writing Ethereum is around 3,775.00 with lightning quick price action.On the 15th of July ETH/USD was around the 2,900.00 level when a buying surge began to be seen and by the 17th, Ethereum was challenging the 3,700.00 ratio. It is important to point out that in early December and into mid-December of 2024, ETH/USD was trading above 4,000.00. And on the 7th of April Ethereum was back to 1,400.00 approximately.Forewarned and Speculatively AttractiveEthereum clearly continues to deliver a bang for the dollar via wagers on speculative direction. ETH/USD reached a high of about 3,950.00 just a couple of days ago. Since Monday’s high ETH/USD has essentially gone sideways and is straddling the 3,700.00 to 3,800.00 vicinity. Speculators who want to wager on Ethereum cannot be blamed, but they need to understand the price velocity and dangers that lurk if things go wrong.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewAs for the reason that Ethereum has rocketed higher in the past few weeks, there is talk about a surge in the DeFi sector once again for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum as a backbone of the cryptocurrency world within exchanges and as component of other digital assets infrastructure is important. However, while influencers hail the surge higher in price, it is good to remember we have been here before only to watch ETH/USD collapse.Talk of the 4,000.00 Level Again in ETH/USDAs the month of August gets ready to start and having witnessed ETH/USD gain substantially in July, traders who are bullish will certainly look upon 4,000.00 as a target. This may be completely legitimate, but for day traders timeframes will be very important.Th',

As previously mentioned, the EUR/USD pair will remain bullish due to selling pressure on the US dollar due to the US Federal Reserve''s policy interventions, along with growing US financial concerns.In Europe, investors have been assessing a wave of inflation data from the region''s largest economies and their implications for the European Central Bank''s (ECB) policy path. According to economic calendar data, consumer price inflation in Germany unexpectedly fell to 2.0% in June from 2.1% in May, returning to the ECB''s target for the first time since October 2024 and defying expectations for a rise to 2.2%. In contrast, inflation in France, Italy, and Spain rose slightly, although it remained relatively subdued. Adding to the cautious sentiment, German retail sales recorded a sharp decline. Despite these mixed signals, money markets continue to price in an ECB terminal rate of approximately 1.75% – 1.80%.

The Euro''s gains intensified as investors assessed comments from European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers following the Eurozone''s inflation rate reaching the ECB''s 2% target.Speaking at the ECB Forum on Central Banking, ECB President Christine Lagarde welcomed the June inflation data, which came in as expected, but cautioned about "two-sided risks" stemming from increasing economic fragmentation and escalating geopolitical tensions. At the same time, other ECB officials indicated that interest rates are likely to remain stable at this month''s meeting, after eight consecutive deposit rate cuts since June 2024.

EUR/USD Technical Analysis Today: Ahead of anticipated new statements from US Central Bank Governor Jerome Powell today, Tuesday, July 22, 2025, the EUR/USD currency pair attempted to move above the 1.1700 resistance, recovering from its recent losses that pushed it towards the 1.1556 support level by the end of last week''s trading. The Euro''s stability comes as investors await the European Central Bank''s (ECB) monetary policy decision and closely monitor trade developments between the EU and the United States. On the monetary policy front, the European Central Bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged next Thursday after eight consecutive cuts, with policymakers adopting a wait-and-see approach amid uncertainty about the impact of higher-than-expected US tariffs and the strong Euro on European growth and inflation. Meanwhile, EU envoys are preparing to meet this week to discuss emergency measures in case no agreement is reached with US President Donald Trump, whose stance on tariffs appears to have hardened ahead of the August 1st deadline. The technical forecasts for EUR/USD still indicate that the currency pair is moving within a counter-bearish channel, supported by its move below the 1.1600 support level. With the gains at the start of the week, the 14-day RSI (Relative Strength Index) has returned to around a reading of 56, moving away from the midline, which gives bulls renewed momentum to push higher.

This comes with a clear break from the pair''s recent bearish reversal, which tested the 1.1556 support level last week. The currency pair''s gains have been amplified by a breakthrough in resolving the US-EU trade dispute. Therefore, it is expected that a resolution to this "war" could deprive the Euro of the fuel needed to continue its ascent against the dollar. This is evident in mid-week currency price movements, as investors feel we are in the final phase of a rapid and turbulent period of global trade reordering orchestrated by US President Donald Trump. According to forex currency market trading, the Euro''s price fell against all its G10 currency counterparts after Trump welcomed a new trade agreement with Japan, a country he had long accused of enjoying an unfair trade advantage over the United States.Details include a 15% tariff on Japanese imports, as well as various other measures by Japan to help boost imports from the United States.

    'The EUR/USD has turned lower in a powerful manner the past handful of days. The currency pair is showing downside pressure and is below the 1.14400 mark as of this writing. Last Thursday the EUR/USD was near the 1.17900 vicinity as selling started to develop. Traders who have been anticipating reversals higher the past couple of day as the EUR/USD fell through key support levels have been disappointed and have likely taken a hit to their trading accounts.The U.S Fed last night surprised few by remaining overly cautious. The EUR/USD was near the 1.15500 juncture at one time yesterday, but continued to sell off instead of producing a fight upwards. As Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chairman, spoke yesterday the EUR/USD fell through the 1.15000 ratio. The currency pair has sustained value beneath the 1.14500 this morning. Those looking for a reversal higher because they believe the EUR/USD is oversold need to be careful.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewRisk Events and Reactions that Appear ComplexThe EUR/USD started the month of July near the 1.18350 level putting in its apex height to start the month, but as August approaches the currency pair is traversing waters within depths not seen since the second week of June. Looking for a tide that lifts the EUR/USD at this moment may feel logical, but complex shifts of sentiment have made financial institutions nervous. Yesterday’s caution from the Federal Reserve was anticipated, but perhaps the stern cautiousness from the Fed Chairman caused more anxiety.Powell doesn’t appear ready to cut interest rates anytime soon. Powell continues to press upon the uncertainty button regarding the potential effects from tariffs. However, in the meantime the U.S GDP numbers came in better than expected yesterday and so did the GDP Price Index. U.S growth was stronger and inflation was weaker. Yet the Fed continues to worry about tariffs. The EUR/USD has sold off massively in the past we',

    'The EUR/USD enjoyed a solid month of upwards price action in June, and as July gets ready to start technical and fundamental traders will have their perspectives tested quickly in the coming days.As of this writing the EUR/USD is near the 1.17280 ratio, which is rather remarkable considering the starting point for the currency pair one month ago.The bullish attitudes in the EUR/USD remained strong the past handful of weeks and the currency pair is certainly testing higher realms not seen since October of 2021.Technical traders will have to likely engage with long-term charts to grow accustomed to the current values the EUR/USD is trading.USD centric weakness has been strong in Forex for a few months. Yes, the Middle East conflict which escalated on the 13th of June caused some temporary risk adverse trading, but by early last week’s ceasefire Forex resumed its negative USD outlook. There is also the factor of an outlook which believes the Federal Reserve will have to begin cutting interest rates in the mid-term which has been priced into the USD in recent weeks.Bullish Sentiment and Federal Reserve Outlook Storm CloudsHighs attained in the EUR/USD which are testing long-term values will now run into questions. The consideration that the currency pair may have become too overbought and will now face a test of choppiness due to certain factors already having been priced in are legitimate. If financial institutions have factored two interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, this could now begin to create headwinds for the EUR/USD as financial institutions consider fair market outlook.Short and near-term considerations regarding the U.S spending bill may also factor into Forex over the first week of July. While it seems likely a budget bill will eventually be passed, it might not come about easily and this could cause storms in Forex until clarity is achieved. There are also potential shadows because of the July 9th tariff deadline via the White House and negotiating n',

The gold price index closed the week stable around $3349 per ounce, amidst a bullish market momentum that could persist until August 1st, the date set by Trump for imposing more tariffs against global economies. The return of US dollar weakness and lower Treasury bond yields allowed the gold market to recover again.The decline in the US dollar and yields coincided with cautious statements from Federal Reserve Governor Waller last Thursday evening. His comments bolstered demand for precious metals as an inflation hedge, as he expressed support for US interest rate cuts at the FOMC meeting on July 29th and 30th. Precious metals markets also received support as a safe haven from global trade tensions, following President Trump''s announcement last Wednesday of his intention to send tariff letters to over 150 countries, notifying them that tariff rates could be 10% or 15% starting August 1st.On the economic front, strong US economic news on Friday showed optimism regarding Federal Reserve policy, while limiting gains in precious metal prices.

    'Gold markets continue to be very noisy during the month of July, and I think August will be more of the same due to a serious lack of volume during the month of August in typical trading years.After all, this is a market that continues to see a lot of volatility and choppiness in a well-defined $300 range, and at this point I’m not sure what it will take to break out of that area.Consolidation RangeTop Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe $3200 level below is a massive support level, just as the $3500 level above is a massive resistance barrier. There is what I considered to be an “inner consolidation area” between the $3300 level and the $3400 level. So, in other words, I think there are plenty of places to see a lot of noise and choppiness, and unless we put some external pressure on this market, we may very well just jump back and forth in the same range for the month. I am bullish in general, but I also recognize that we need some type of momentum to get things moving.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewAll things being equal, I do believe that eventually we could break out to the upside, but I don’t know if it will be during the month of August. If it is, then it probably means that the US dollar is falling, or perhaps there is a major “risk off” move in the markets, and gold will be used to protect wealth. I do recognize that we have been in a long-term uptrend for some time, at least until the last couple of months. This consolidation area lines up perfectly with the old adage of “sell in May and go away” that Wall Street quite often will quote. Perhaps that’s all there is, but if we were to break down below the $3000 level, then I think you’ve got a situation where gold really starts to crumble. I give that about a 15% chance, so I am still looking at short-term pullbacks as buying opportunities.Ready to trade our monthly forecast?

In an environment like this, it’s obvious that no matter what happens, there are people out there willing to buy this market, as it seems like every other day, we get a headline about tariffs or trade problems that could end up being negative for the markets, but they are forgotten about the next day.
