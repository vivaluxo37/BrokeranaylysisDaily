    'GoldGold markets obviously have been at the forefront of everybody’s thought process lately, and this last week would have been no different. With that being said, it’s probably worth noting that we are seeing hesitation above the $3.400 level for the 3rd week in a row. This doesn’t necessarily mean that gold is going to fall apart, but I do think we have some work to do to get moving. That being said, you should also keep in mind that the US and Chinese delegates meet this weekend.GBP/USDThis is one of the most interesting charts for me on the weekly timeframe in the world of forex.

This makes sense, as Canada still does not have a trade deal with its most important trading partner, the United States. By extension, this means that the Canadian economy is going to remain under pressure, and therefore I think we will see the greenback continue higher.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThis is an interesting chart as well, as we have seen market participants go in both directions all week, as we tested the 1.12 level at the very lows, but have since bounced quite nicely.
