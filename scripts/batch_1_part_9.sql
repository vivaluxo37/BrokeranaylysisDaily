XRP has been traded with solid volume since it started to make formal agreements with financial institutions. Ripple Labs started with the promise of providing its users a revolutionary payment protocols system for banking transactions with quicker times to settle the transfer of funds at cheaper costs.The value of XRP/USD has been very volatile since 2017. My Ripple price prediction for 2025 sees the coin trading between $1.15 and $8. By the year 2030 Ripple could be valued between $6 and $15. These forecasts are based on market sentiment and the utilitarian capabilities of Ripple via its XRP coin.The XRP/USD coin’s primary use is making the clearing of funds easier for financial institutions and businesses associated with them. XRP/USD not a ''standard'' cryptocurrency like many of its major counterparts, the distributed ledger from Ripple is internal. Ripple Labs coding is ‘open source’, but XRP/USD uses a centralized system in which Ripple controls the allocation of the XRT coins, sometimes to the dismay of its skeptics.The fact that XRP/USD is centralized has become not only a ‘concern’ for many cryptocurrency influencers, but has also created a legal argument with the SEC. The Security Exchange Commission has in essence declared they believe the XRT coin is a ‘secured asset’, which would mean it has legal oversight domain. An official lawsuit was initiated by the SEC in December of 2020 against Ripple Labs and some of its executives. A contested fight within the U.S court system is anticipated.Is Ripple Undervalued?Ripple''s XRP coin does not have an unlimited supply. The initial minting of XRP coins was said to be 100 billion. The current price of XRP/USD is near $0.67 cents. In early April 2021, XRP/USD was trading within sight of $2.00 as the broad cryptocurrency market enjoyed a heightened state of exuberance.The fall to its current price level has XRP/USD testing important support values', 'Ripple, XRP/USD, may rise over the coming years.

There was a time when LTC/USD was rated within the top 5 of cryptocurrency market capitalizations as its proponents argued positively regarding its merits compared to the likes of Bitcoin. This caused a groundswell of support as people asked what the price of Litecoin would be several years in the future.Litecoin was essentially created in 2011. However the digital asset began trading in earnest with wide market interest in 2017 like many of its major counterparts, when cryptocurrencies jumped into the spotlight as their speculative gains caught the attention of the financial media. Like the other major cryptocurrencies, LTC/USD essentially went from a speculative asset few had ever heard of in early 2017 with a value of little more than nothing, to a digital asset that achieved a high price above $400 per coin in December that same calendar year. However, Litecoin then suffered a large fall in value over the coming year in line with the broader cryptocurrency market.Litecoin compared to Bitcoin was held up as a faster cryptocurrency regarding the ability to ‘mine’ its blockchain, and its transactional ability was also hailed as faster than Bitcoin, and these elements remain true to this day for the decentralized digital asset. However, not everything has been wine and roses for Litecoin early adapters, speculators and investors. Litecoin, like all cryptocurrencies, has enjoyed days of highs and extreme lows as technical and market behaviors have frequently caused storms.At the time of writing in August 2021, LTC/USD has gone through the whirlwind of its spring 2021 surge and slump like most of the major cryptocurrencies. The month of August certainly produced a rather nice climb for Litecoin, but prior to this bullish trend, LTC/USD suffered steep losses and saw lows just above $100', 'Litecoin is not one of the biggest or most famous cryptocurrencies, yet it is a potentially interesting investment opportunity.', 'a-long-term-litecoin-price-prediction-for-2025', 'General', 'Broker Analysis', NULL, 'published', '2025-08-21T13:01:31.124648', '2025-08-21T13:01:31.124655', 'C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\BrokeranalysisDaily\daily forex\www.dailyforex.com\forex-articles\2021\08\a-long-term-litecoin-price-prediction-for-2025\167190.html', 'Litecoin is not one of the biggest or most famous cryptocurrencies, yet it is a potentially interesting investment opportunity.'), ('Australia vs IC Markets: What Does It Mean? [year, month]', 'Australian billionaire Andrew Budzinski, 49, founded the renowned Australian CFD and Forex broker IC Markets. He was 2024’s 65th wealthiest Australian, with a net worth of A$2.71 billion, and faces two separate lawsuits that could cost him hundreds of millions of dollars if he is found liable.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe secretive, little-known billionaire and IC Markets face a class action lawsuit for pocketing A$1+ billion in profits and dividends on the back of heavy losses by the broker’s retail traders. An additional lawsuit charges Budzinski with violating Fair Work policies by berating staff using homophobic slurs, threatening to withhold salaries, and sacking the entire Australian office. The question is, do the lawsuits hold merit, and what might the outcomes mean for the Australian and global retail trading industries?The second lawsuit, about Fair Work violations, targets the character of Budzinski in allegations made by a former disgruntled employee targeting Finohelp Support Pty Ltd., a support services company that assisted IC Markets with payroll. So, I will not dive into what may or may not have occurred, as it has no direct impact on CFD and Forex traders in Australia. The class action lawsuits should concern Australian-resident traders, however, as they could open the gates for more counter-productive regulatory changes, pushing Australia further behind competitive alternatives.What Should You Know Before We Look at The Allegations?Between 70% and 90% of retail traders lose money, which has less to do with leverage maximums and more to do with a lack of market education, discipline, and knowledge. Regulators cannot force traders to acquire the necessary knowledge to trade more profitably, or to use proper risk management, or comprehend the relationship between risk management, position sizing, and leverage. So, they lower the maximum leverage as a blunt regulatory tool.

Let’s find out more about base currency and what it means in Forex.AdvertisementTake advantage of today''s market opportunitiesSTART TRADING NOWUnderstanding base currencyThe base currency in a currency pair, such as USD/GBP, is the first currency specified (where the USD is the base currency). The quotation, also known as the counter currency, is the second currency. We generally expect the base currency to increase in respect of the quote/counter currency whether you "long" the currency pair. You would predict the reverse if you were "short" on the pair.What Are Examples of Base Currency?The euro versus the US dollar, generally known as EUR/USD, is the most frequently traded currency pair. Here''s an illustration of how to understand currency pairs:It''s 2024, and John is planning a trip to California. He lives in England and only carries pounds sterling. As a result, he goes to a forex agency to convert his GBP to USD. The rate is USD/GBP = 1.4, according to the Forex executive.
