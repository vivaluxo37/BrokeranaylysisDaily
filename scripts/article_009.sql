('United States GDP Declined 0.5% in Q1 2025',
    'US Final GDP data released on Thursday was a disappointment, with an annualized decrease in the first quarter of 2025 of 0.5%, revised downwards from the second estimate in May of -0.2%. The downward revision was due to decreases in consumer spending, exports and government spending.The first-quarter GDP release marks a sharp reversal from Q4 2024, in which the US economy expanded 2.4% year-on-year, and this is the first time in three years that the US economy has declined.The BEA noted that the current US Dollar GDP, which does not account for the impact of inflation on the current value of GDP, increased by 3.2% year-on-year, lower than the 3.4% gain in the second estimate.The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 3.4% in the first quarter, up from 3.3% in the second estimate. Similarly, the core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy and is closely watched by the Fed, rose 3.7% in Q1, up from 3.6% in the second estimate.Thursdayâ€™s weak GDP report is a clear indication that the US economy is slowing down, but the labour market remains surprisingly resilient. Initial jobless claims, released today, dropped to 236,000, down from an upwardly revised 246,000 in the previous release and below the consensus of 245,000. If the US labor market continues to post strong numbers, market expectations for a rate cut in the next few months will increase.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewUS Dollar Loses Ground, Stock Markets Slightly HigherIn the Forex market, the US dollar has retreated against all the major currencies in the aftermath of the GDP and unemployment claims report.
