('How Market Volatility Affects Execution',
    'Volatility is a hot topic for financial educators, traders, and investors. If you are unfamiliar with the term, it refers to a scenario where market prices rapidly rise and drop within a very short period. Depending on their trading or investing style, some skilled or even professional traders may actively avoid or choose to trade during volatility. Although potential rewards may be more significant during volatility, the risk increases exponentially.Although there is no direct correlation between volatility and execution, trying to open a trade while prices are moving rapidly can lead to price differences between what a trader expects and what they get. It’s like trying to hit a rapidly moving target with a ball, something that’s relatively challenging. In the best-case scenario, your trade may open at a more beneficial rate. In the worst-case scenario, your trade opens at a rate that causes unforeseen losses or yields a smaller return than intended.Exness helps traders mitigate this by filling their orders at the best market price available at the given moment. Thanks to a robust infrastructure of strategically located servers worldwide, their order execution* is both fast and reliable.What causes volatility?Several factors fuel volatility, but in simple terms, it occurs when traders are unsure about an event, news item, or political occurrence that will affect the markets. Here’s a more specific breakdown of these factors.NewsInformation can come from any source, but as long as it reaches an audience of market participants likely to spread market-moving news, that information can have an impact. These include traditional financial media like Forbes, Bloomberg, and the Wall Street Journal, as well as social media and trading communities like those on Discord.GeopoliticsDuring the beginning of 2025, the new US administration waffled on tariffs. The enacted ones triggered retaliatory tariffs from the targeted countries, resulting in volatility as markets feared a ra',

('Understanding trading costs & how PrimeXBT stands out',
    'Trading fees are often accepted as part of the cost of trading — a necessary friction in an otherwise fluid market. But for serious traders, these costs are more than incidental — they’re a performance lever.However, the true cost of trading goes beyond visible charges. It’s embedded in the structure behind each trade — from slippage and spread behavior to platform reliability under pressure. In this sense, cost-efficiency isn’t just about low fees — it’s about the structural integrity of the entire trading experience.This is where PrimeXBT stands out. With low fees, a transparent pricing model, and a stable, high-performance platform, it delivers cost efficiency by design. Its VIP Tiers program plays a central role in that structure — helping traders save more when they trade.What traders often overlookWhile most traders pay attention to headline fees like commissions or taker rates, many of other costs live in the background.Latency, the time it takes for a trade to execute, can quietly affect entry and exit points.Slippage, the difference between expected and actual execution price, becomes especially costly in volatile markets.Spread widening during news events or low-liquidity periods can inflate the cost of a trade well beyond what was anticipated.Platform overload is when a platform lags or freezes during high-activity moments, the result isn’t just frustration — it''s a missed opportunity.These aren’t hypothetical scenarios. For active traders, they’re part of the daily reality — and they add up.That’s why low fees alone aren’t enough — and experienced traders know it. Some platforms advertise “zero commission” models but quietly make up for it with wide spreads, restricted access to tools, or hidden charges. Others place essential features behind paywalls or limit asset access unless higher account types are unlocked.How PrimeXBT is built differentlyPrimeXBT addresses the hidden friction points of trading with infrastructure built for speed, stability, and c',
