    'WTI/CL CrudeThe West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil market fell pretty significantly during the trading week, as we are looking to close below the $60 level. This is an area that I think attracts a lot of attention, mainly due to the fact that we had bounced so significantly from there previously. That being said, the market is closing below the $60 level, so we do need to be somewhat cautious at this point in time. All things being equal, this is a market that I think will continue to see a lot of volatility as traders are worried about demand. Ultimately, this is a sideways market at the moment, leading to the downside.GoldThe gold market initially tried to rally for the week but then fell rather hard. It’s interesting to see that the gold market is falling while the stock market is rallying. We have had a major negative correlation between gold and stocks as of late, so I’m paying close attention to the $3200 level, and then again, I would be watching at the $3000 level for some type of bounce that I can start buying again.AUD/USDThe Australian dollar has a positive week, as we are now breaking above the 50 Week EMA. By doing so, the market looks as if it is ready to continue going higher, perhaps looking to the 200 Week EMA near the 0.67 level. Ultimately, this is a market that is probably getting some benefit from the idea of China quietly looking for a trade deal with the United States, which would have a major influence on the Australian economy as they are a major supplier of raw materials for China and of course the overall economic engine that drives the rest of the world as far as manufacturing is concerned.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThe euro has been all over the place during the course of the week, as we continue to look for some type of directionality.

Despite that, the week ended with US stock markets and the US Dollar firmly higher.Last week’s major data points were:US Core PCE Price Index – came in a fraction lower than expected, showing no change over the month, which was logically bearish for the greenback but bullish for US stocks.US Average Hourly Earnings – a fraction lower than expected, showing only a 0.2% increase on the month, which reinforced the point 1. above.US Non-Farm Employment Change – this was larger than expected, somewhat contradicting the potentially recessionary Advance GDP data.US Advance GDP – this showed a shock 0.3% decline over the past month, when it was expected to increase by 0.2%.

A trade deal between the UK and the USA was announced, the first such deal since Trump regained office last January.

However, the July deadline remains for trade deals and this issue will heat up again as July approaches.Beyond that, although not especially significant, the major events of last week were the slightly hawkish rhetoric from Jerome Powell, Fed Chair, about an elevated risk of inflation requiring rates to be kept higher for longer, and the Bank of England’s widely expected 0.25% rate cut.

The talks, involving key officials like US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, aim to reduce tariffs, previously 145% on Chinese goods and 125% on US exports—that have disrupted supply chains and raised recession fears.A potential deal could stabilize equities, increase risk appetite, and drive capital into assets like Bitcoin, seen as a hedge against economic uncertainty.Reduced tariffs could also weaken the US dollar, enhancing Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value.

    'The month of June was very volatile for the crude oil markets worldwide, as Israel and Iran going to war obviously causes quite a bit of heartburn when it comes to crude oil supply and how people will look at pricing it.That being said, we have since seen the Israelis and Iranians agreed to a cease-fire, and all of that volatility and massive move to the upside has simply rolled right back over.In other words, we have seen the market rally all the way from $65 to the $79 region or so and then drop right back down to the $65 level again. June has been an absolute migraine inducing environment.Are We Recovering Finally?Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewI have a little bit different take on the crude oil market at the moment than most people. What I’ve noticed is that there is a significant amount of hesitation near the $65 level, and that is an area that previously had been significant resistance over the course of about 2 months. The market finding a bit of sideways action in that region makes a certain amount of sense because of the “market memory”, but I also believe that crude oil was trying to break out to the upside before conflict broke out between Iran and Israel. That ended up being the catalyst to really get things moving, but now that we are back where we started, I think they are looking to recover a bit in the month of July.This doesn’t necessarily mean that we take off to the stratosphere, but I think what it means is that the market is going to continue to grind higher more than anything else. Cyclically speaking, this is typically a very positive time of year for crude oil, and unless we get some type of external shock over the next month, it’s likely that we will start to focus on that again. After all, demand picks up in the United States, as well as the European Union during the summer, all things being equal.

    'Ether (ETH) rallied approximately 20% from six-week lows at $2,100 on June 22 to a high of $2,526 on June 29. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 9% over the last week and 35% over the last 90 days.With a market capitalization of $298 billion, Ether cements its position as the second most valuable cryptocurrency, according to the CoinMarketCap ranking.Apart from the uptrend in the wider crypto market fueled by increased inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs and Bitcoin’s rally to $108,000 over the weekend, other fundamental factors and onchain metrics back Ethereum’s potential to follow in BTC’s footsteps to reach new all-time highs and possibly top out at $10,000 in 2025.Dwindling Exchange SupplyOne factor supporting Ether’s upside is reducing supply on exchanges. Data from onchain market intelligence firm Glassnode shows Ether’s reserve on exchanges reached a nine-year low of 16.15 million ETH on June 23, after dropping 10% over the last 90 days.ETH Exchange Supply. Source: GlassnodeThe total balance between inflows and outflows in and out of all known exchange wallets shows a steep decline since October 2023, when withdrawals from the crypto trading platforms began to surge. This drop accompanies a 130% rise in ETH price over the same period.Decreasing ETH supply on exchanges simply means investors could be withdrawing their tokens into self-custody wallets. This indicates a lack of intention to sell in anticipation of a price increase in the future.This is explained by a spike in accumulation by large holders over the last few weeks. More data from Glassnode shows that wallets holding $100,000 and $1 million or more worth of ETH have been on the rise since the start of April.Number of ETH Wallets with Balances > $100K and $1M.

Gains extended to the 1.1641 resistance level at the time of writing, marking the pair''s highest point since 2021. The Euro''s gains increased amid the US dollar''s weak performance as traders continue to assess the situation in the Middle East.

As mentioned before, the $3300 per ounce resistance will remain a strong catalyst for bulls to advance technically.Will gold prices rise soon?According to gold analysts'' forecasts, spot gold prices are expected to see a sharp increase due to escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, ignited by news of a US airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities. This development is driving strong demand for safe-haven gold bullion. Consequently, analysts now expect gold prices to range between $3500 and $3700 per ounce, as investors hedge against geopolitical instability and inflation risks.On the other hand, there is a catalyst for the gold market. Global central bank reserves continue to accumulate. According to the World Gold Council, central banks added a total of 290 metric tons in the first quarter of 2025, the strongest first quarter on record.

According to performance across gold trading platforms, selling pressure on the yellow metal increased as financial markets assessed the sustainability of the ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Tehran and Tel Aviv had agreed to a temporary ceasefire after exchanging strikes since last week. However, reports of fresh missile launch, and strike orders raised scepticism about the truce''s validity and fuelled concerns that the conflict would soon resume.Furthermore, this occurred after the exchange of controlled strikes between Iran and the United States minimized collateral damage and preceded a period of apparent de-escalation. This reduced gold''s appeal as a safe haven and prevented its price from retesting record highs of $3,500 in late April.

Furthermore, we are starting to see the US dollar stiffen it’s resolve against the basket of major currencies that we typically followed. In other words, we may be in the middle of turning things around.GBP/USDThe British pound initially did try to rally during the course of the week but gave back gains.

All things being equal, the “market memory” should come into the picture, but if we break down below that level, then I think the British pound might find itself in a little bit of trouble. On the other hand, if we can break above the 1.3650 level, the British pound could really start to take off.DAXThe German index did rally a bit during the course of the week, but it is starting to show signs of hesitation around the €24,000 level.

We are currently in the middle of a lot of choppy behavior, and I think we have a situation where market participants will have to look at this from a short-term perspective more than anything else, as we look like we are trying to find a reason to continue the overall uptrend but just do not have it at the moment.WTI Crude OilThe WTI Crude Oil market had a very strong week, breaking toward the crucial $65 level. The market breaking above the $65 level is a very positive sign, so I will be watching that this week. A move above could open up a move to the $68 level, possibly even the $72.50 level. Underneath, we have a massive amount of support near the $60 level, so as long as we can stay above there, I still think there are plenty of buyers in this market as the US economy is stronger than the market had been pricing in previously, if the jobs numbers are to be believed.NASDAQ 100The NASDAQ 100 rallied for the week, breaking above the 21,800 level, and threatening overall highs near 42,100. All things being equal though, the market is a little bit extended, and I think we may see some choppy behavior as we try to push through the major swing high that we had melted down from.

    'EUR/USDThe euro rallied a bit during the trading week, breaking above the 1.16 level, but we have given back some of the gains after the Israeli airstrikes on the Iranian regime. This of course has people running toward safety currency such as the US dollar, so it does make sense that we have seen hesitation. However, earlier in the week we had seen quite a bit of bullish pressure, so one would have to assume that there is at least some demand out there for the euro. I suspect the next couple of weeks will be very violent but may have a bit of a bid for them.USD/MXNThe US dollar spent most of the week falling against the Mexican peso, but turned around after the airstrikes, and because of this we are sitting right at the 200 Week EMA. We are also at the crucial 19 MXN level, so if we were to bounce from here it would make a certain amount of sense, but I see a lot of resistance near the 19.40 MXN level, so whether or not it is going to truly rally remains to be seen, I think that could be an area where we could see some issue. A break above the 50 Week EMA could send this pair to the 20 MXN level.GBP/USDThe British pound has been all over the place during the week, as we continue to see a lot of questions asked of the US dollar. That being said, after the airstrikes on Friday, we have seen a little bit of a pushback against risk-taking, so it’ll be interesting to see how this plays out.

Breaking below that level opens up the possibility of a move down to the 18.5 MXN level, possibly even lower than that. However, we have recently seen a certain amount of negativity coming out of the US economy, which while you would think that would be very negative for the US dollar, the reality is that it has horrific effect on the Mexican economy as the Mexicans send roughly 85% of their exports into America.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewIn other words, the Mexicans have to worry about their biggest customer, and if they do in fact see the Americans slowing down into a recession, they will be buying as many Mexican goods.If we get to that situation, then a break above the 19.50 MXN level could be possible, and it could even open up a move to the 20 MXN level. However, I suspect that this would be more of a “shock to the system” type of more than anything else. If things stay somewhat stable over the next several weeks, then it’s likely that we will see the US dollar continue to suffer a little bit of negativity against the Mexican peso as the interest rate differential most certainly favors the Mexican peso over the US dollar.
