Somewhere in that general vicinity, I would love to see a pullback, followed by a bounce that I can start buying. That being said, if we break down below the $6000 level, then things might be changing. However, I suspect that you will know that some type of external pressure is being applied to the market, and therefore you can just simply trade according to the overall risk appetite sentiment.However, the market bouncing the way it has from the beginning of April suggest that there are plenty of buyers out there willing to get involved, even if we are a little overdone. To the upside, I would anticipate that the $6500 level could be a bit of a target, and if we can break above there then I think buyers will jump in and try to take advantage of the overall uptrend. I have no interest in shorting the market, at least not until we break down below the $6000 level, and even then, I would need to have an actual reason. We could have a bit of a “zombie rally” going through the month, meaning that we just simply drift higher in a very slow and methodical manner.Ready to trade our monthly forecast?
