      question: `What trading platforms does ${broker.name} offer and which is best for beginners?`,
      answer: `${broker.name} provides a comprehensive suite of trading platforms to suit all experience levels.

      question: `What is the maximum leverage offered by ${broker.name} and what are the risks?`,
      answer: `${broker.name} offers leverage up to ${broker.maximum_leverage}, allowing traders to control larger positions with smaller capital. However, it's crucial to understand that leverage amplifies both profits and losses. Higher leverage increases risk significantly - while you can make larger profits, you can also lose more than your initial investment. The broker provides negative balance protection, ensuring you cannot lose more than your account balance. Leverage regulations vary by region: EU clients are limited to 1:30 for major forex pairs due to ESMA regulations, while clients in other jurisdictions may access higher leverage. We strongly recommend using conservative leverage, especially for beginners, and never risk more than you can afford to lose. The broker provides risk management tools including stop-loss orders and margin call alerts.`,

      question: `How does ${broker.name}'s trust score of ${broker.trust_score}/100 compare to other brokers?`,
      answer: `${broker.name}'s trust score of ${broker.trust_score}/100 is calculated using our comprehensive methodology that evaluates regulation (25 points), security (20 points), transparency (20 points), reputation (15 points), and customer service (20 points). ${broker.trust_score >= 80 ? 'This excellent score places the broker in the top tier of regulated brokers, indicating strong regulatory compliance, robust client protection measures, and excellent service quality.' : broker.trust_score >= 60 ? 'This average score indicates the broker meets basic regulatory requirements but may have areas for improvement in client protection or service quality.' : 'This below-average score indicates significant concerns that traders should carefully consider. We recommend exploring alternative brokers with higher trust scores.'} The score is updated regularly based on regulatory changes, user feedback, and industry developments. Our methodology is transparent and available for review, ensuring objective and reliable broker assessments.`,
