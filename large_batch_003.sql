('Forex Today: Markets Expect US Inflation Unchanged Today',
    'Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe focus will shift today to the release of US CPI (inflation) data, with the annualized rate expected to remain unchanged.Markets will be focusing today on the upcoming release of US CPI (inflation) data. It is widely expected that the annualized rate will remain unchanged at 2.4%, with month-on-month CPI expected to show an increase of 0.3%. If the data is higher than expected, that could boost the USD and sink US stocks; if lower than expected, the opposite will be likely.The big news yesterday was the announcement of a trade deal between the USA and China, who have been engaged in a noisy and destructive trade war since Trump took office in January. It was agreed that during an upcoming 90-day period for further negotiations, the US would drop tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China would drop tariffs on US imports from 125% to 10%. The US Dollar and US stock markets immediately jumped and held these increases, with the NASDAQ 100 Index up by 4.4% on the day and the S&P 500 Index closing higher by 3.3%. Asian stock markets have mostly continued this rally, although Chinese indices are trading lower today. This news is likely to be bullish for global risk-on sentiment generally, including stock markets.Following yesterday''s trade deal between the USA and China, markets are now expecting only 2 US rate cuts over the course of 2025, at 0.25% each, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The first cut is not expected until September.In the Forex market, since today''s Tokyo open, the Australian Dollar has been the strongest major currency, while the USD has been the weakest, putting the AUD/USD currency pair in focus - the Aussie typically gains when global risk sentiment improves. However, it can be said that the USD strength we saw yesterday is likely to hold up over the coming days.Bitcoin dropped quite sharply yesterday after coming close to testing its record high made',

('US Inflation Unchanged but Core CPI Accelerates',
    'The US consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-on-year in July, unchanged from the June figure and below the market estimate of 2.8%. CPI remained at its lowest annual inflation rate since February 2021. Monthly CPI eased, rising to 0.2% from 0.3%, in line with market expectations. Gasoline and fuel oil prices continued to decline sharply, a key factor in easing inflation.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, moved in the opposite direction. Annual CPI climbed to 3.1% in July, up from 2.9% and above the market estimate of 3.0%. This marked the highest level in five months. Monthly, the core rate rose 0.3%, up from 0.2% and in line with the market estimate.The rise in core CPI reflects the effect of Trump''s tariffs, which took effect in April and continue to filter through the economy. The tariffs are expected to dampen growth and raise inflation, as US consumers pay more for imported goods.Inflation Report Likely Cements Rate Cut in SeptemberThe Federal Reserve has been on an extended pause and hasn''t lowered interest rates since December 2024. That is expected to change at the next Fed meeting, barring an extreme surprise. The markets have currently priced in a 94% likelihood of a rate cut at the Sep. 17 meeting, up sharply from 84% just before the inflation release. Investors were clearly relieved that CPI remained at 2.7% and didn''t rise to 2.8% as expected, anticipating that this will clear the path for the Fed to lower rates next month.US Dollar Shows Muted Response, Stock Market Edges Higher after Inflation ReportThe US dollar is showing little reaction following the release of the US inflation report, while the US stock market is in positive territory.The GBP/USD currency pair is trading at 1.3482, up 0.35% on the day, but most of these gains were recorded ahead of the inflation release.The US stock market has posted gains on Tuesday, as investors reacted positively to the inflation report.The S&P 500',

The pair continued to move around the 34.50 lira levels without any significant improvement or decline after the interest rate decision issued by the Turkish Central Bank last Thursday, which kept the interest rate unchanged for the eighth consecutive time at 50%. Moreover, the Central Bank''s decision did not contradict the expectations that prevailed in the markets.The decision came with the aim of continuing to curb inflation, which showed a higher rise than market expectations over the months of September and October. Despite the continued monetary tightening, the bank''s statement issued after the interest rate decision did not overlook pointing to the approaching cycle of easing monetary policy in the near future. Bank analysts "Goldman Sachs" and "Morgan Stanley" expect this phase to begin next month, or by the beginning of next year, 2025. Obviously, these expectations may be closer to realization if inflation rates for the month of November record a significant decline compared to previous months.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewFurthermore, the data issued over the past months showed a continued decline in inflation in the country, but it was a disappointing slo',

The pair''s trading stabilized amid anticipation of the Turkish Central Bank''s decision on interest rates, which is scheduled to be announced later today. Concurrently, Most estimates indicate that the interest rate will be held steady after the bank cut the interest rate by 250 basis points in the December meeting.Previously, the Turkish Central Bank had announced new steps within the framework of its strategy to reduce the "protected deposit accounts against foreign exchange fluctuations" program, as part of the gradual shift towards more traditional economic policies. As of January 20, 2025, opening and renewing protected accounts with maturities of six and 12 months will be stopped, according to a statement by the central bank. The statement also explained that this step aims to reduce the protected deposit program, which was launched in December 2021 to support the stability of the Turkish lira and reduce dollarization. The program, which guaranteed depositors protection against exchange rate fluctuations, was criticized for its high cost and negative impact on the budget.

Recently, the Central Bank of Turkey has adopted a strategy aimed at enhancing the attractiveness of the Turkish lira to investors by offering high returns. Obviously, this strategy is based on allowing the lira to depreciate against the dollar but ensuring that the rate of depreciation is less than the inflation rate. Furthermore, this approach aims to reduce the impact of currency weakness on rising prices.Over the past year, the lira has depreciated by 16% against the dollar in nominal terms. However, when taking inflation into account, the lira recorded significant gains, the best since 2007. This policy provided a unique opportunity for foreign investors, as they could achieve returns of over 50% by investing in Turkish lira bonds, making it one of the most attractive options in the financial markets.At the same time, the report indicated an improvement in the value of the lira, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan',

This is an area that’s been important a couple of times in the past but at this point in time it looks like it is still going to be thought of as a target. If we can break above there, then the market is likely to continue to go higher, perhaps opening up a move to the $35.50 level. Short-term pullbacks should continue to be potential buying opportunities in this market, as it obviously has a lot of underlying upward pressure. I don’t think things change very quickly.GoldGold markets continue to be very noisy, and it is worth noting that we did sell off during the day on Thursday, but quite frankly I think this is a market that any time we get some type of decent pullback, people will be willing to step in and pick up “cheap gold.” I believe that the $3200 level underneath is a significant support level, as it was significant previously, and then after that we have the $3000 level that could offer a bit of a short-term floor as well. After all, there is a large, round, psychologically significant aspect of that level.WTI Crude OilThe West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil market has a definite air of positivity under it, with the $60 level offering support. The market looks as if it is going to try to get to the $65 level sooner rather than later, and if we can break above there, it’s very possible that the WTI Crude Oil market could break even higher than that, perhaps making a run toward the $70 level.

    'USD/JPYThe US dollar initially fell against the Japanese yen but has found enough support near the 140 level to turn things around and bounce quite significantly. It’s interesting, because the 140 level has been a major support level going back some time now, and it’s also worth noting that the 200 Week EMA sits there as well. By forming this massive hammer, and the fact that some of the rhetoric out there has gone off the rails, it’s starting to look more and more like the US dollar is in the process of bottoming. Furthermore, the Japanese yen looks like it is giving up some of that strength.USD/CHFThe US dollar initially fell during the course of the week to break down below the 0.81 level, only to turn around and bounce all the way toward the 0.83 level. The US dollar looks like it is ready to rally from here, but whether or not it can change the overall trend is a completely different question. If we can break above the 0.84 level, then I think we have a situation where we could rise as high as 0.8750 level. However, if we turn around a breakdown below the weekly candlestick, then we could drop to the 0.80 level eventually.GBP/USDThe British pound has rallied significantly during the course of the week, but it found the 1.34 level to be far too resistant to continue. By doing so, we ended up forming a bit of a shooting star. This is a market that is overbought, so a pullback makes quite a bit of sense at this point in time. In fact, I am seeing this across the board when it comes to the US dollar, so I think all things are leading to the same scenario, where the greenback is suddenly going to strengthen. That being said, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the British pound will fall apart, just that we have certainly gotten too far ahead of ourselves. However, if we were to break above the 1.34 level on a weekly close, we could really start to accelerate to the upside.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThere are',

The Central Bank continues to intervene amidst the sharp fluctuations witnessed in global markets due to statements by US President Donald Trump, ranging from passing tariff increases to postponing them for 90 days. Consequently, these fluctuations have widened a wave of intense foreign capital outflows. During the period between March 14th and 28th, outflows of 14 billion dollars were recorded from foreign investment portfolios.According to data published on X, the Turkish Central Bank injected approximately 10.7 billion dollars from its foreign currency reserves in just two days, distributed between 7.6 billion dollars on April 7th and 3.1 billion dollars on the 8th of this month.

    'USD/CADThe US dollar has plummeted against the Canadian dollar during trading this past week, as we are now testing the crucial 1.3750 level. The 1.3750 level is an area that is very important, and at this point in time, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of volatility and potential support, but at this point, I would need to see the US dollar recapture the 1.39 level to begin to think about buying against the Canadian dollar, despite the fact that there is still no trade agreement between the 2 economies.Crude OilThe crude oil markets have been all over the place during the week, as we tested the $65 level but then turned around to show signs of hesitation. The $60 level seems to be offering support, and if we can stay above that level, then I think you’ve got a real opportunity to go back and forth on short-term chart. I think that’s probably the most likely turn of events, but Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs being recommended against the European Union starting June 1, and that could be negative for oil, only time will tell. If we can recapture the $65 level on a daily close, then I think crude oil can rally quite nicely.USD/JPYThe US dollar fell rather significantly during the trading week against the Japanese yen, and now that we have more chaos involving tariffs, it’s possible that we could see the Japanese yen continue to strengthen. This flies in the face of the interest rate situation, and at this point in time I am fairly neutral about this pair. I believe there is a ton of support between current levels in the ¥140 level, so I am looking for stability and a turnaround to start buying.

    'GoldGold markets obviously have been at the forefront of everybody’s thought process lately, and this last week would have been no different. With that being said, it’s probably worth noting that we are seeing hesitation above the $3.400 level for the 3rd week in a row. This doesn’t necessarily mean that gold is going to fall apart, but I do think we have some work to do to get moving. That being said, you should also keep in mind that the US and Chinese delegates meet this weekend.GBP/USDThis is one of the most interesting charts for me on the weekly timeframe in the world of forex. Quite frankly, we are struggling mightily to break above the 1.34 level, and the fact that we are finishing the week with a candlestick that looks a lot like a shooting star, and preceded by 2 actual shooting stars, tells me that we are on the precipice of a potential strengthening of the US dollar. By contrast, if we can break above the 1.35 level, the British pound could soar at that point, perhaps picking up another 500 pips. Nonetheless, it’s worth noting that there are several charts starting to hint that the US dollar is potentially going to make a comeback.USD/CADThis is one of those charges I was speaking about. The engulfing candlestick on the weekly chart suggest that buyers have stepped in and started buying the greenback against the Canadian dollar in mass. This makes sense, as Canada still does not have a trade deal with its most important trading partner, the United States. By extension, this means that the Canadian economy is going to remain under pressure, and therefore I think we will see the greenback continue higher.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThis is an interesting chart as well, as we have seen market participants go in both directions all week, as we tested the 1.12 level at the very lows, but have since bounced quite nicely.

That being said, the €23,500 level looks to be a significant support level as we have bounced nicely from there, and ultimately, I think we have a situation where the market has recently broken above significant resistance, and it’s likely that we will continue to see buyers on each and every dip. I suspect at this point the DAX will go looking to the €25,000 level.USD/JPYThe US dollar initially fell during the week against the Japanese yen, but the ¥145 level has offered support. All things being equal, this is a market that continues to see a lot of volatility, but there are a lot of buyers underneath that will continue to come into the market and choose the US dollar due to the interest rate differential, as the Bank of Japan has absolutely no real chance of tightening anytime soon.
