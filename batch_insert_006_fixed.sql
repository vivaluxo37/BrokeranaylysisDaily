Milestones range widely from the adoption of cutting-edge trading technology to developing expertise that supports clients as they pursue their goals and strategies.The foundation years: 2010–2015IronFX was founded with a clear vision to give retail traders access to the kind of trading conditions once only reserved for institutional investors. From day one, the founding team focused on building strong operational systems and transparent processes. This robust infrastructure set the groundwork for years of consistent performance and future growth.A notable early step in this phase was the adoption of the MetaTrader 4 (MT4) platform. MT4 was and remains a leading trading solution for forex and CFD traders because of its speed, stability, and array of technical tools.By integrating this trusted platform, the company gave its clients a reliable research and trading management environment with features like one-click trading and customisable charting, and highlighting the belief that every trader deserves access to world-class tools.Compliance was another early pillar for the broker. Obtaining its first regulatory licence not only enabled the company to operate in reputable jurisdictions but also helped build trust among its expanding user base. Financial regulation requires rigorous policies on funds segregation and transparency, to name a few. The early commitment to being a regulated broker set a standard for reliable operation that has been sustained ever since.Offices were opened in major financial centres, including London, Sydney, and Johannesburg, to meet international demand.

    ''Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe focus will shift today to the release of US CPI (inflation) data, with the annualized rate expected to remain unchanged.Markets will be focusing today on the upcoming release of US CPI (inflation) data. It is widely expected that the annualized rate will remain unchanged at 2.4%, with month-on-month CPI expected to show an increase of 0.3%. If the data is higher than expected, that could boost the USD and sink US stocks; if lower than expected, the opposite will be likely.The big news yesterday was the announcement of a trade deal between the USA and China, who have been engaged in a noisy and destructive trade war since Trump took office in January. It was agreed that during an upcoming 90-day period for further negotiations, the US would drop tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China would drop tariffs on US imports from 125% to 10%. The US Dollar and US stock markets immediately jumped and held these increases, with the NASDAQ 100 Index up by 4.4% on the day and the S&P 500 Index closing higher by 3.3%. Asian stock markets have mostly continued this rally, although Chinese indices are trading lower today. This news is likely to be bullish for global risk-on sentiment generally, including stock markets.Following yesterday''''s trade deal between the USA and China, markets are now expecting only 2 US rate cuts over the course of 2025, at 0.25% each, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The first cut is not expected until September.In the Forex market, since today''''s Tokyo open, the Australian Dollar has been the strongest major currency, while the USD has been the weakest, putting the AUD/USD currency pair in focus - the Aussie typically gains when global risk sentiment improves. However, it can be said that the USD strength we saw yesterday is likely to hold up over the coming days.Bitcoin dropped quite sharply yesterday after coming close to testing its record high made'',

(''US Inflation Unchanged but Core CPI Accelerates'',
    ''The US consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-on-year in July, unchanged from the June figure and below the market estimate of 2.8%. CPI remained at its lowest annual inflation rate since February 2021. Monthly CPI eased, rising to 0.2% from 0.3%, in line with market expectations. Gasoline and fuel oil prices continued to decline sharply, a key factor in easing inflation.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, moved in the opposite direction. Annual CPI climbed to 3.1% in July, up from 2.9% and above the market estimate of 3.0%. This marked the highest level in five months. Monthly, the core rate rose 0.3%, up from 0.2% and in line with the market estimate.The rise in core CPI reflects the effect of Trump''''s tariffs, which took effect in April and continue to filter through the economy. The tariffs are expected to dampen growth and raise inflation, as US consumers pay more for imported goods.Inflation Report Likely Cements Rate Cut in SeptemberThe Federal Reserve has been on an extended pause and hasn''''t lowered interest rates since December 2024. That is expected to change at the next Fed meeting, barring an extreme surprise. The markets have currently priced in a 94% likelihood of a rate cut at the Sep. 17 meeting, up sharply from 84% just before the inflation release. Investors were clearly relieved that CPI remained at 2.7% and didn''''t rise to 2.8% as expected, anticipating that this will clear the path for the Fed to lower rates next month.US Dollar Shows Muted Response, Stock Market Edges Higher after Inflation ReportThe US dollar is showing little reaction following the release of the US inflation report, while the US stock market is in positive territory.The GBP/USD currency pair is trading at 1.3482, up 0.35% on the day, but most of these gains were recorded ahead of the inflation release.The US stock market has posted gains on Tuesday, as investors reacted positively to the inflation report.The S&P 500'',

The pair continued to move around the 34.50 lira levels without any significant improvement or decline after the interest rate decision issued by the Turkish Central Bank last Thursday, which kept the interest rate unchanged for the eighth consecutive time at 50%. Moreover, the Central Bank''''s decision did not contradict the expectations that prevailed in the markets.The decision came with the aim of continuing to curb inflation, which showed a higher rise than market expectations over the months of September and October. Despite the continued monetary tightening, the bank''''s statement issued after the interest rate decision did not overlook pointing to the approaching cycle of easing monetary policy in the near future. Bank analysts "Goldman Sachs" and "Morgan Stanley" expect this phase to begin next month, or by the beginning of next year, 2025. Obviously, these expectations may be closer to realization if inflation rates for the month of November record a significant decline compared to previous months.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewFurthermore, the data issued over the past months showed a continued decline in inflation in the country, but it was a disappointing slo'',
