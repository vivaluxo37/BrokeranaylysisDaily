# CONTENT POPULATION IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

## Database Integration Tasks

### Task 1: Homepage Content Integration
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
**Priority**: Critical

**Files to Modify**:
1. `app/page.tsx` - Main homepage component
2. `components/TopBrokersGrid.tsx` - Broker listings
3. `components/BlogInsights.tsx` - Article listings
4. `components/ProgrammaticCards.tsx` - Dynamic recommendations

**Implementation Steps**:
```typescript
// 1. Create Supabase data fetching functions
async function getTopBrokers() {
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('brokers')
    .select('name, slug, overall_rating, trust_score, logo_url')
    .order('overall_rating', { ascending: false })
    .limit(6)
  return data
}

// 2. Replace mock data with real data
export default async function HomePage() {
  const topBrokers = await getTopBrokers()
  const latestArticles = await getLatestArticles()

  return (
    <div>
      <TopBrokersGrid brokers={topBrokers} />
      <BlogInsights articles={latestArticles} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Task 2: Individual Broker Pages Fix
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours
**Priority**: Critical

**Current Error**: Server-side component issues in `/brokers/[slug]`

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check `app/brokers/[slug]/page.tsx` for import errors
2. Verify Supabase connection in broker data fetching
3. Fix missing icon imports causing component failures
4. Test with available broker slugs: `vanguard`, `interactive-brokers`

**Implementation Template**:
```typescript
// app/brokers/[slug]/page.tsx
export default async function BrokerPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const { data: broker } = await supabase
    .from('brokers')
    .select('*')
    .eq('slug', params.slug)
    .single()

  if (!broker) {
    notFound()
  }

  return <BrokerDetailComponent broker={broker} />
}
```

### Task 3: Blog Performance Optimization
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Priority**: High

**Current Issues**:
- FCP: 15.6 seconds (Critical)
- TTFB: 15 seconds (Critical)
- Supabase connection timeouts

**Optimization Strategy**:
1. Implement proper caching for article content
2. Optimize Supabase queries with select specific fields
3. Add loading states and error boundaries
4. Implement incremental static regeneration (ISR)

### Task 4: Missing Critical Pages Implementation
**Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours
**Priority**: High

**Pages to Create**:
1. `/brokers` - Main broker listing (2-3 hours)
2. `/compare` - Broker comparison tool (4-5 hours)
3. `/privacy` and `/terms` - Legal pages (1-2 hours)

## Programmatic SEO Implementation

### Strategy × Country Pages (30 pages)
**Template Structure**:
```
/[strategy]/brokers/[country]
- /scalping/brokers/us
- /swing-trading/brokers/uk
- /day-trading/brokers/au
```

**Content Generation Approach**:
1. Create dynamic route: `app/[strategy]/brokers/[country]/page.tsx`
2. Filter brokers by strategy requirements and country regulations
3. Generate unique intro content using AI
4. Create strategy-specific FAQs
5. Implement proper SEO metadata

**Database Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM brokers
WHERE
  trading_platforms && ARRAY['MT4', 'MT5'] -- for scalping
  AND regulation_info->>'countries' LIKE '%US%'
  AND spreads_info->>'eur_usd' < 1.0 -- tight spreads for scalping
ORDER BY trust_score DESC
```

### Asset-Specific Pages (5 pages)
**Pages**: `/forex-brokers`, `/crypto-brokers`, `/stock-brokers`

**Implementation**:
1. Create category-based filtering
2. Display brokers specializing in each asset class
3. Add asset-specific comparison metrics
4. Include educational content for each asset type
