Bitcoin is consolidating above $121,000, and Ethereum is steady near $4,741. The absence of sharp pullbacks in majors is allowing BNB to maintain momentum without facing aggressive profit-taking pressure.$830 Support and $865 Resistance Define the Current RangeThe immediate support for BNB now sits in the $830–$835 band. This range has already absorbed several profit-taking events this week, proving its importance for short-term stability.If price breaks below this level, the next area of interest is $802–$805, a pivot zone marked by prior consolidation.Resistance is building at $860–$865. Sellers have repeatedly capped rallies here in recent sessions. A close above $865 on strong volume would signal a potential push to $880–$900.Breaking $900 could trigger follow-on buying from momentum traders and test historical resistance zones seen in earlier market cycles.Technical Indicators Suggest Momentum With Caution SignsMomentum remains on the side of buyers, though some indicators are showing early signs of overheating.

('Crypto Bulls Are Back: BTC and ETH Surge on Spike (Chart)', 'Cryptocurrency bulls are back on the advance after a couple of weeks in which bears made a concerted effort to reclaim the ground lost in July. Since hitting a record high above $123,000 on July 14, Bitcoin (BTC) entered a period of consolidation, largely holding above $118,000, before world events helped bears drive the price of King Crypto to a low of $111,940 on August 3.Since then, bulls have taken control, stair-stepping BTC back above $119,000 to hit a high of $122,290 on Monday, and are looking poised to push into uncharted territory.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewAiding bulls in their efforts was the Tuesday release of the July US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which showed inflation holding at 2.7% year-over-year, unchanged from June and below the 2.8% forecast.The boost in Bitcoin’s price comes as market watchers continue to increase their expectations for a September Fed interest rate cut, with the CME FedWatch tool indicating a 94.2% probability of a 25-basis-point cut. While the CPI data shows that inflation remains above the Fed’s target rate of 2%, many hope that the improvement thus far will convince them to lower rates and ease financial pressures.Cryptos also saw a spike in prices and trading volume after U.S. President Donald Trump directed financial regulators to expand access to alternative investments in 401(k) plans, including digital assets and privately owned companies.According to market analyst Merlijn The Trader, the ensuing recovery marked the end of Bitcoin accumulation, and up next comes the face-melting parabolic phase.Bitcoin Accumulation is over.

According to reliable trading platforms, the euro''''s gains have increased as the US dollar weakened to its lowest level since late July. This was driven by US inflation data, which strengthened expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, boosting global risk appetite.On the European side, the European Central Bank (ECB) ended its monetary easing cycle in July after eight cuts over the past year, leaving borrowing costs at their lowest since November 2022.

Following the start of the Trump-Putin summit late last week, the EUR/USD pair recovered to the 1.1715 resistance level, close to its highest point in two weeks. Forecasters expect the euro to benefit if US President Donald Trump is able to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.The foreign exchange market''''s focus is on the meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where a significant breakthrough on a ceasefire is hoped for.

However, this is not a core expectation.It''''s unrealistic to expect a deal on Friday, but there''''s a strong possibility that it could pave the way for an eventual end to the conflict.

At this point, it’s worth noting that the US dollar sold off a bit but held firm against certain currencies. In other words, it looks like the volatility is only somewhat justified, and I think at this point in time it’s worth noting that the $36 level seems to be a significant support level just waiting to happen. If we can recapture the $37.50 level, we will probably reenter the range that we had been in during the previous month.GBP/USDThe British pound has plunged for most of the week, testing the crucial 1.32 region. However, we have found a little bit of support at the end of the week as the jobs number in the United States was horrible. This has the US dollar on the back foot just a little bit, but quite frankly, it has held its own fairly well, all things being considered. If we break down below the 50 Week EMA at the 1.3063 region, I suspect that the British pound will start to fall apart. If the British pound falls apart against the US dollar, the greenback probably swallows everything else right along with it.EUR/USDThe euro dropped fairly significantly during the course of the week to peek below the 1.15 level for a while but did recover a bit after the Non-Farm Payroll number came out of the United States much weaker than anticipated. This is an ugly candlestick regardless, so I do think this is a situation where if we get any follow-through whatsoever, namely a breakdown below the bottom of the weekly candlestick from the one that we just printed, the euro could be in serious trouble at that point.
