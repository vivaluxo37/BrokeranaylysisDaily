    'Ripple Labs initiated its business in 2012 under the name of Opencoin. XRP has been traded with solid volume since it started to make formal agreements with financial institutions. Ripple Labs started with the promise of providing its users a revolutionary payment protocols system for banking transactions with quicker times to settle the transfer of funds at cheaper costs.The value of XRP/USD has been very volatile since 2017. My Ripple price prediction for 2025 sees the coin trading between $1.15 and $8. By the year 2030 Ripple could be valued between $6 and $15. These forecasts are based on market sentiment and the utilitarian capabilities of Ripple via its XRP coin.The XRP/USD coin’s primary use is making the clearing of funds easier for financial institutions and businesses associated with them. XRP/USD not a ''standard'' cryptocurrency like many of its major counterparts, the distributed ledger from Ripple is internal. Ripple Labs coding is ‘open source’, but XRP/USD uses a centralized system in which Ripple controls the allocation of the XRT coins, sometimes to the dismay of its skeptics.The fact that XRP/USD is centralized has become not only a ‘concern’ for many cryptocurrency influencers, but has also created a legal argument with the SEC. The Security Exchange Commission has in essence declared they believe the XRT coin is a ‘secured asset’, which would mean it has legal oversight domain. An official lawsuit was initiated by the SEC in December of 2020 against Ripple Labs and some of its executives. A contested fight within the U.S court system is anticipated.Is Ripple Undervalued?Ripple''s XRP coin does not have an unlimited supply. The initial minting of XRP coins was said to be 100 billion. The current price of XRP/USD is near $0.67 cents. In early April 2021, XRP/USD was trading within sight of $2.00 as the broad cryptocurrency market enjoyed a heightened state of exuberance.The fall to its current price level has XRP/USD testing important support values',

('A Long-Term Litecoin Price Prediction for 2025',
    'Litecoin HistoryLitecoin entered the world of cryptocurrency with a rather impressive start when digital assets began to find favor with speculators and investors throughout the globe. There was a time when LTC/USD was rated within the top 5 of cryptocurrency market capitalizations as its proponents argued positively regarding its merits compared to the likes of Bitcoin. This caused a groundswell of support as people asked what the price of Litecoin would be several years in the future.Litecoin was essentially created in 2011. However the digital asset began trading in earnest with wide market interest in 2017 like many of its major counterparts, when cryptocurrencies jumped into the spotlight as their speculative gains caught the attention of the financial media. Like the other major cryptocurrencies, LTC/USD essentially went from a speculative asset few had ever heard of in early 2017 with a value of little more than nothing, to a digital asset that achieved a high price above $400 per coin in December that same calendar year. However, Litecoin then suffered a large fall in value over the coming year in line with the broader cryptocurrency market.Litecoin compared to Bitcoin was held up as a faster cryptocurrency regarding the ability to ‘mine’ its blockchain, and its transactional ability was also hailed as faster than Bitcoin, and these elements remain true to this day for the decentralized digital asset. However, not everything has been wine and roses for Litecoin early adapters, speculators and investors. Litecoin, like all cryptocurrencies, has enjoyed days of highs and extreme lows as technical and market behaviors have frequently caused storms.At the time of writing in August 2021, LTC/USD has gone through the whirlwind of its spring 2021 surge and slump like most of the major cryptocurrencies. The month of August certainly produced a rather nice climb for Litecoin, but prior to this bullish trend, LTC/USD suffered steep losses and saw lows just above $100',

    'Australian billionaire Andrew Budzinski, 49, founded the renowned Australian CFD and Forex broker IC Markets. He was 2024’s 65th wealthiest Australian, with a net worth of A$2.71 billion, and faces two separate lawsuits that could cost him hundreds of millions of dollars if he is found liable.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe secretive, little-known billionaire and IC Markets face a class action lawsuit for pocketing A$1+ billion in profits and dividends on the back of heavy losses by the broker’s retail traders. An additional lawsuit charges Budzinski with violating Fair Work policies by berating staff using homophobic slurs, threatening to withhold salaries, and sacking the entire Australian office. The question is, do the lawsuits hold merit, and what might the outcomes mean for the Australian and global retail trading industries?The second lawsuit, about Fair Work violations, targets the character of Budzinski in allegations made by a former disgruntled employee targeting Finohelp Support Pty Ltd., a support services company that assisted IC Markets with payroll. So, I will not dive into what may or may not have occurred, as it has no direct impact on CFD and Forex traders in Australia. The class action lawsuits should concern Australian-resident traders, however, as they could open the gates for more counter-productive regulatory changes, pushing Australia further behind competitive alternatives.What Should You Know Before We Look at The Allegations?Between 70% and 90% of retail traders lose money, which has less to do with leverage maximums and more to do with a lack of market education, discipline, and knowledge. Regulators cannot force traders to acquire the necessary knowledge to trade more profitably, or to use proper risk management, or comprehend the relationship between risk management, position sizing, and leverage. So, they lower the maximum leverage as a blunt regulatory tool. This gives the illusion',

    'Currency pairings are used to estimate currency unit prices in the forex market. The base currency (also known as transaction currency) is the initial currency mentioned in a currency pair quote, succeeded by the quote currency (also known as the counter currency). A financial firm can use the base currency as the accounting currency or domestic currency to reflect all profits or losses for financial reporting reasons.Base Currency Definition in ForexIn the Forex market, the base currency is the first of two currencies seen in a currency pair quote. After the base currency, the quotation mentions the counter currency. Let’s find out more about base currency and what it means in Forex.AdvertisementTake advantage of today''s market opportunitiesSTART TRADING NOWUnderstanding base currencyThe base currency in a currency pair, such as USD/GBP, is the first currency specified (where the USD is the base currency). The quotation, also known as the counter currency, is the second currency. We generally expect the base currency to increase in respect of the quote/counter currency whether you "long" the currency pair. You would predict the reverse if you were "short" on the pair.What Are Examples of Base Currency?The euro versus the US dollar, generally known as EUR/USD, is the most frequently traded currency pair. Here''s an illustration of how to understand currency pairs:It''s 2024, and John is planning a trip to California. He lives in England and only carries pounds sterling. As a result, he goes to a forex agency to convert his GBP to USD. The rate is USD/GBP = 1.4, according to the Forex executive. This implies that $1 is worth 1.4 GBP.In my case, the quote currency is GBP, and the base currency is USD. As a result, John can swap 1.4 GBP for USD 1 at the Forex market.There are numerous distinct currency pairs around the world, and they are classified according to the frequency and magnitude of their dealings.

('Blockchain in Forex Trading – All You Need to Know!',
    'Forex trading is the latest market that blockchain technology is disrupting in 2025.The Forex market, which is operational 24/7, and blockchain, which provides the technological basis for cryptocurrency trading, are ideal for integration. Blockchain offers transparent, secure, fast, and cost-effective transaction methods. For this reason, the technology holds incredible promise for the Forex industry, although certain challenges need to be overcome. In this article, we''ll dig deep into how blockchain has the potential to transform Forex trading, the pros and cons for the industry, and how this technology can be leveraged.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow Blockchain WorksA blockchain is a ledger (a digital record of transactions) that executes secure transactions in a peer-to-peer network. It processes, stores, verifies, and records data automatically on the network, usually with a decentralized system. So, for two people to transact, there''s no need for an intermediary such as a bank or payment processor.When a blockchain is decentralized, this means that no single entity has complete control. It can be governed communally, by hundreds, if not thousands, of network nodes. As a result, it is incredibly secure, as there''s no single point of failure. That means that data cannot be modified or deleted without a network consensus.The primary use case for blockchain technology is that it allows people to transact cryptocurrencies, although blockchains can now integrate other types of data and use smart contracts. This enables the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can take real-world assets such as property and data onto the blockchain. So, when it comes to Forex trading, traditional fiat currency can be merged with blockchain technology to increase trade efficiency.Public vs Private BlockchainsThere are two distinct types of blockchains:Public blockchains are decentralized and open, so anyone can participate a',

    'Intro to Trading StocksTop Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHere are ten essential takeaways for trading stocks:Buying a stock means buying a piece of a company. That’s why stocks are also called shares: owning a stock is owning a “share” of a company. If I buy one Apple share, it literally means I own a (tiny) piece of the company Apple.Companies issue stocks to raise capital to finance their business. When a company issues stocks for the first time, it is called an “Initial Public Offering” (IPO).A stock exchange is a centralized body that “lists” companies’ shares for brokers to buy and sell on behalf of their clients. The largest stock exchange in the world is the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE), with over two thousand different companies’ stocks. Stock exchanges are highly regulated to protect investors and companies participating in them.Some companies pay dividends, which are direct payments from their profits to the stock''s owners. I remember my dad getting physical dividend checks from companies whose stocks he owned!Some trading instruments allow trading the price of a stock without physically buying and selling it. For example, CFDs and futures contracts can mirror the stock price but do not involve holding the stock itself. The advantage is trading on leverage and taking short positions, both of which are not always possible when trading the stock directly. The best stock brokers offer a wide selection of individual stocks for trading at competitive fees, overseen by sufficient regulation.Options contracts (i.e., “call” and “put” options) are also a popular method of trading stocks. They allow traders to access leverage, take short positions, and find unique ways to profit from stock price movements. For example, some option strategies allow traders to profit if a stock price stays in a specified range.The primary measure of a stock’s fundamental value is its price-earnings ratio or “PE.” This is the stock’s pr',

This knowledge and the strategies I adopted have been game-changers for me and many successful crypto traders.Let’s look at:Cryptocurrency day trading strategiesA step-by-step guideDos and Don’ts in day tradingWhat Is Crypto Day Trading?A cryptocurrency day trade involves entering a trading position in a cryptocurrency and then exiting the position in a short-term time frame, usually within the same day. For example, I buy Bitcoin at 10 a.m. and sell the position at 3 p.m. to complete a day trade.Cryptocurrency markets run 24/7 without an official opening or closing time each day. That means cryptocurrency day trading can happen at all hours of the day. The strict definition of day trading is to open and close a trading position on the same day. However, if a position remains open a little more than a day, I also classify that as day trading for the sake of this article.That means day trading has a short-term focus on immediate moves that require precise timing to catch.Why Day Trade Cryptos and Bitcoin?Liquidity and VolatilityThe best markets for day trading are those with liquidity and volatility. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are highly liquid and volatile, making them excellent for day trading.Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its market price.

I believe it will continue to do so for many generations to come. I will lay out my case for why I believe all traders should consider trading Forex.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow Retail Forex Revolutionized Retail TradingTo understand why retail Forex is alive, let’s look at how it’s revolutionized retail trading. I began trading Forex in the early 2000s. Before then, only institutions and high-net-worth individuals, usually requiring a minimum account size of $500,000, were able to trade currencies. At the time, most retail traders focused on equities and equity options, with a small proportion also trading futures contracts. When retail Forex emerged, it immediately exploded in popularity and quickly became the hot new thing.Retail traders had never seen an asset class like it, and Forex trading introduced many first experiences. For example, Forex was the first time many traders encountered leverage, and the first time they learned about over-the-counter markets that operated without centralized exchanges. In fact, because new Forex brokers advertised heavily to the public, retail Forex encouraged many to try trading for the first time.The emergence of retail Forex also helped increase the popularity of technical analysis methodology.Then, in 2005, MetaTrader 4 was introduced, specifically for Forex brokers. Before MetaTrader, most independent trading platforms required costly subscriptions or purchases. MetaTrader was free and used by almost all Forex brokers, making it immediately popular. Traders then started sharing MetaTrader trading templates (e.g., indicator settings) and automated systems (Expert Advisors), subscribing to signals and copying trades from other MetaTrader users. Suddenly, thanks to MetaTrader, many traders began collaborating',

('NZD/USD Eyes Resistance Before RBNZ Rate Cut',
    'Following the RBNZ cutting its Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 50 basis points (bps) in November 2024, economists and investors expect another bumper 50 bp rate reduction on Wednesday this week – with an outside chance of a more minor 25 bp reduction. A 50 bp (25 bp) adjustment would bring the OCR to 3.75% (4.00%). In addition, markets are also expecting another 75 bps worth of cuts this year.Sluggish Economic ActivityI’ve observed little reason to stray from market pricing and expect an additional 50 bp cut this week. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth fell into a technical recession in Q3 24 after printing a second consecutive quarter in negative territory; the -1.5% contraction was the lowest figure since Q2 20. Additionally, unemployment has risen to its highest level since late 2020 at 5.1% (Q4 24), and given inflation remains within the RBNZ’s 1-3% target band – Q4 24 inflation increased to 2.2% (matching the 2.2% print in Q3 24) – the central bank has ‘room’ to lower the OCR.With a 50 bp cut largely baked in, and assuming the central bank follows through, I expect a knee-jerk sell-off across New Zealand dollar (NZD) pairs. That said, most focus will be on any change in the rate statement’s language, press conference commentary, and any revisions in the updated economic projections.NZD/USD Vulnerable to the DownsidePrice action on the monthly timeframe for the NZD/USD (New Zealand dollar versus the US dollar) came within a stone’s throw of testing long-term support from US$0.5511 this month. Anyone following candlestick patterns may note that the current monthly candle is poised to close by way of a bullish engulfing formation. While monthly support is clear, and the bullish engulfing pattern indicates buyers may want to explore higher terrain, the rebound in October 2022 failing to print a meaningful high may concern long-term bulls. Couple this with the overall long-term trend facing south, and any higher rebound could be short-lived.This brings me to the daily',

('Tax on Forex Trading in South Africa [year]',
    'South Africa recognizes Forex trading as a legitimate activity, and the South African Revenue Services (SARS) requires South African residents to pay taxes on Forex trading profits. In short, all South African residents must declare their Forex profits for tax purposes, and there is no getting around it. Like most nations’ revenue-collecting services, SARS will impose penalties for not paying taxes.Let’s look at how SARS taxes Forex trading and explore some tax planning strategies that Forex traders can use.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow Are Forex Trading Profits Taxed in South Africa?Forex trading profits are subject to regular income tax rates in South Africa (unless an individual has set up a company for their Forex trading). Taxpayers can deduct trading-related expenses (e.g., computer equipment, trading courses, software, etc.) from their Forex profits to reduce their taxable income.SARS publishes the applicable “tax rates for individuals” here on its website. Individual tax rates are a progressive system with higher percentages at higher income levels. The lowest tax rate is 18%, and the highest is 45% above a specified income level. Each year, SARS adjusts the income levels for each percentage income tax rate.The Provisional Tax payment system applies to Forex trading profits because trading is not a salaried activity under the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax-paying system. Let’s examine how the Provisional Tax system works.What Is Provisional Tax?Forex trading gains are subject to the SARS “provisional tax” payment method.Although “provisional tax” sounds like a separate tax type, like income tax, or inheritance tax it is not. Instead, it is a method of spreading tax payments to SARS over the year instead of in one annual lump sum at the end of the tax year. SARS uses the provisional tax payment system to even out cash flow for taxpayers, rather than facing them with a large single payment at the end of the ye',

('US Tariffs - Trump’s Tariffs and the Markets, [year, month]',
    'Markets have been roiled by US President Trump’s announcement of strong new tariffs on all trading partners, followed by a 90-day suspension. How this process plays out will be key to the future of the markets over 2025 and probably beyond.1. The Trump administration is committed to implementing tariffs.2. The administration is willing to enforce tariffs at levels that match the rhetoric.I believe this second realization, i.e., the sheer levels of the tariffs the U.S. was willing to enact, was the primary catalyst that caused much of the global equity markets’ sell-off in early April 2025.The proposed tariff levels are massively uneven among nations, depending on the Trump administration’s view of how specific nations contribute to a trade deficit. Negotiations between world leaders and Trump’s team are happening at a pace that alters the landscape daily.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewWhere We Stand NowAt the time of writing, Trump paused global reciprocal tariffs for 90 days from April 9, with one notable exception: China. His pause followed days of equity and bond markets'' sell-off that could have led to a financial meltdown, and the U.S. public would have widely considered Trump responsible in such an event. In my mind, Trump’s team underestimated the market decline and loss of public support that would follow the tariff announcements, hence the abrupt pause.However, the Trump administration will seemingly continue a baseline 10% tariff on most nations that started on April 5. Had it not been for the extra tariffs and market volatility, this alone would be a headline news item.The exception for China is stark. Currently, the U.S. has set a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, and China has retaliated with an 84% tariff on U.S. goods—numbers that would have been unthinkable a week ago. The U.S. is in a trade war with China, with neither country wishing to back down, and neither country has an off-ramp. This is uncharted t',

('How to Count Pips on US30? Experts US30 Pip Calculator Guide',
    'What is the US30?US30 is a common ticker name for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The DJIA is a major stock average in the USA which is always composed of 30 publicly traded companies listed on US stock exchanges.The DJIA has been around for a long time. It was first created as an indicator to gauge the state of the American stock market in the late 19th century. However, it has been somewhat overtaken by broader, more modern stock indices such as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100 indices. In particular, the S&P 500 Index has taken the DJIA’s old role as the barometer of the American stock market.The DJIA is price weighted, unlike modern stock indices, which are weighted by market capitalisation.The DJIA’s member companies are typically old “blue chip” companies which are involved in industrial processes, and as such, is somewhat less relevant to the modern American economy, which has become increasingly service based since the 1960s.What Is One Pip Change in US30?A pip change is the measurement used for change amounts within an exchange rate of a currency pair. It’s calculated from the last decimal point. Most major currency pairs are priced to within four decimal places, so the smallest change could be 1/100 or one percent (0.0001), which is one basis point.However, currency crosses for the Japanese Yen (EUR/JPY) have a pip of 0.01. For metals like silver and gold, a pip is 0.01 on the US30.Here’s an example: the GBP/USD moves from 1.3935 to 1.3936, so there is one pip change. If you’re using a five-digit broker and the GBP/USD moves from 1.39355 to 1.39360, there’s a half a pip change (0.5 pip).Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow to Measure Pips in BTC/USD on US30When measuring pips for BTC/USD pairs on the US30, it’s similar to when you’re trading gold - XAU/USD.

('Why Every Country Is Racing to Launch a Central Bank Digital',
    'Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are tipped as the most significant monetary shift in 50 years, since the US left the gold standard in 1971. As of 2025, 137 countries, making up 98% of global GDP, are engaged in researching, developing, and piloting national CBDCs.Governments are racing to launch digital currencies into their economies to avoid being left behind in an industry predicted to reach $213 billion in transaction volume by 2030.In the article, you’ll learn why countries are launching CDBCs, how China’s e-CNY is leading the way, and the challenges facing central banks in their quest for digital transformation.What is a CBDC?A Central Bank Digital Currency or ‘CDBC’ is a digital form of a sovereign nation''s legal currency. Most often, they are blockchain-based cryptocurrencies that are issued and controlled by governments or central authorities. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, a government-issued CDBC is legal tender and can be used for payments of goods or services.The concept of CDBCs is still relatively new, and very few nations have actually launched this new style of digital money. Most countries are still developing, testing, and piloting CDBCs, but they are likely to be officially implemented with increasing speed over the coming years.While the architecture is still being designed, most will rely on a two-tier system where a country''s central bank issues the coins, and commercial banks are responsible for distribution. CBDCs rely on blockchain technology to deliver 24/7, instant settlement, while smart contracts enable deeper levels of financial automation.Motivations for CBDC AdoptionA big attraction for governments is the traceability and transaction history recorded on a blockchain network. This provides complete traceability for ‘digital cash’ compared to traditional notes and coins, which are not traceable.Centralized control is a significant factor in the distinction between CDBCs and traditional cryptocurrencies.
