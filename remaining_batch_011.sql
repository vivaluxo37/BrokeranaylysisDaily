('SP 500 Monthly Forecast: August 2025 (Chart)', 'The S&P 500 has been very bullish heading into the month of July, and it looks very much like a market that is trying to break out to higher levels.That being said, the market is a little stretched going into the beginning of the month, so I am anticipating a little bit of a short-term pullback in order to offer enough value for traders to get involved in.Furthermore, the month of August is typically very negative as far as volume is concerned, so it would make a certain amount of sense that we might drift a little bit lower during the month, only to turn around and show signs of strength again.Support BarriersTop Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewI believe that there is a significant amount of support near the $6300 level, but I also recognize that the $6150 level could offer support. Somewhere in that general vicinity, I would love to see a pullback, followed by a bounce that I can start buying. That being said, if we break down below the $6000 level, then things might be changing. However, I suspect that you will know that some type of external pressure is being applied to the market, and therefore you can just simply trade according to the overall risk appetite sentiment.However, the market bouncing the way it has from the beginning of April suggest that there are plenty of buyers out there willing to get involved, even if we are a little overdone. To the upside, I would anticipate that the $6500 level could be a bit of a target, and if we can break above there then I think buyers will jump in and try to take advantage of the overall uptrend. I have no interest in shorting the market, at least not until we break down below the $6000 level, and even then, I would need to have an actual reason. We could have a bit of a “zombie rally” going through the month, meaning that we just simply drift higher in a very slow and methodical manner.Ready to trade our monthly forecast?

The USD/INR is traversing within sight of record heights seen on the 10th of February, this when the USD/INR came close to the 88.0000 level. The USD/INR is trading for the moment around 87.5400 with fast action. Yesterday’s price velocity higher was triggered when President Trump began aiming strong tariff rhetoric towards India, when he apparently became convinced that the nation was not going to cooperate in a manner he deemed correct.India apparently is remaining stubborn regarding tariff negotiations, and the U.S White House is not backing down from its stance that India must lower its import duties on U.S products. President Trump has stated India faces a tariff of 25% if it does not bend its trade policy. Prime Minister Modi appears to be in a difficult position because he risk political problems in the Indian legislature due to promises made to those who have been supporting Modi’s political party – the Bharatiya Janata Party.Implications and Intrigue with the USD/INRIf Prime Minister Modi changes his stance regarding his trade policies within the BJP it could cause political instability and weakness in the next election. The USD/INR went from nearly 86.8000 yesterday to a high of 87.8080 with strong price velocity when President Trump began his rhetoric assault. Via Trump’s public messages yesterday on social media, the White House made it clear that the tariff stance is not only about trade between the U.S and India, but also India’s energy policy with Russia that is not seen favorably by the Trump administration. India is a large buyer of Russian energy and this will be hard to change.The tactic of scolding India publicly about its energy policy will not be warmly received in India and could cause Prime Minister Modi to make a public stance that is uncomfortable.

If a trader somehow was not paying attention to global news and the Forex markets, they would assume everything has been calm and normal trading has been seen. However, the Middle East conflict between Iran and Israel that escalated on the 13th of June certainly caused widespread concerns, and India’s financial assets including the Indian Rupee were directedly effected.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe USD/INR had been trading near the 85.5300 ratio on the 12th of June, then as the war between Iran and Israel began to make news on the 13th, there was a gap higher and the 18.26000 realm was quickly hit. Financial institutions in India reacted quickly, but they also acted with an experienced hand, this because India has dealt with conflicts which have effected its marketplace through the decades. The USD/INR was simply correlating to risk adverse momentum in Forex and the currency pair touched highs as tensions in the Middle East built to within sight of 87.0000.Important Notes on Highs in the USD/INRHowever, while highs were quickly achieved in the USD/INR it is important to note that they did not touch realms in mid-February and March of this year. In fact the USD/INR in essence only tested highs seen in the second week of April when tariff rhetoric from the U.S White House was influencing Forex. It is also important to note the reversal lower which developed immediately upon the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel was very strong and also correlated to the broad Forex market.By Tuesday of last week the USD/INR fell below the 86.0000 level and continued to incrementally sell off.

('USD/MXN Monthly Forecast: August 2025 (Chart)', 'The US dollar has been very choppy during the month of July against the Mexican peso, as we are searching for some type of directionality from here.I suspect that we will see more of the same noise in August, mainly due to the fact that August is typically a fairly quiet month to begin with, and this is a pair that is something that is highly specialized for a certain part of the world and a certain trading session.After all, there is very little volume in the USD/MXN pair outside of the North American session, and therefore the fact that Wall Street is going away for vacation could very well put this pair in a consolidation move.Technical AnalysisTop Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewAs far as the technical analysis is concerned, it’s obvious that we have been very negative for the majority of 2025. I don’t think that changes anytime soon, but a little bit of a bounce would make a certain amount of sense. The 19 MXN level above is a significant area due to the large, round, psychologically significant figure in and of itself, and of course the 200 Week EMA is sitting right there as well. Ultimately, this is a scenario where market participants continue to look at this through the prism of the interest rate differential favoring Mexico, and of course the fact that the Mexican peso tends to do fairly well when the US economy does.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewKeep in mind that Mexico is the largest exporter to the United States, so if the US economy continues to be very strong, that almost certainly will help the Mexican economy as so much of its goods end up in the United States. With that being said, I think that we may get a little bit of a bounce, but I’m still looking to play short-term rallies to show signs of exhaustion, opening up an assault and attack on the 18.50 MXN level underneath, where we have of course found the little bit of support.Ready to trade our monthly forecast?

('USD/ZAR Monthly Forecast: August 2025 (Chart)', 'The USD/ZAR traded within site of 18.00000 yesterday this as the currency pair correlated to growing nervousness ahead of the Fed’s interest rate statement this evening, and the anticipated tariff rhetoric that will play out over the next couple of days. While the U.S, Japan and the E.U have seemingly produced agreed upon trading mandates, a host of other nations are still trying to define terms and South Africa is among them. South Africa has asked for more time to reach an agreement and it is uncertain if the U.S White House will grant this wish.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHowever, before day traders read too much into tariff concerns and the results in the USD/ZAR, they need to note that the recent bullish action which started on the 23rd of July has mirrored a lot of trading for other major currencies paired against the USD. The USD/ZAR will likely become volatile over the next handful of hours before Jerome Powell releases the Fed’s FOMC Statement. Some traders may be tempted to believe the currency pair looks overbought, but the near-term may continue to produce choppy elevated conditions.Sentiment Shifts and the USD/ZAR WatersTrading in the USD/ZAR has been quite comfortable in July. There have been tests of resistance and support levels, but the 17.47000 ratios were tested in the first week of the month and again only a handful of days ago. Reversals higher have certainly been seen, but some volatility in the South African Rand is a given and its results have also frequently demonstrated solid resistance slightly below the 17.90000 vicinity with occasional outliers higher.The USD/ZAR is trading near the 17.86800 ratio as of this writing and fluctuations are showing a wide spread, this as financial houses brace for the Fed interest rate policy statement.

Also noteworthy, the USD/ZAR touched the 17.57800 vicinity this past Thursday as financial institutions leaned into USD weakness across global Forex markets.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe high seen early last week was a direct reflection of nervousness because of the Middle East conflict and fear of escalation, but a reversal lower quickly generated upon the news of a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel. The lows seen last Thursday likely developed on the notion the U.S Federal Reserve will have to consider cutting interest rates over the mid-term. The USD/ZAR has been able to sustain its lower values and appears ready to enter July insight of important support targets.South Africa and Optimistic Outlooks ConsideredFinancial institutions have been able to correlate the USD/ZAR to the growing belief over the past few months that the USD is going to become weaker. The USD/ZAR was trading at a high of 19.9500 on the 9th of April, this as global investors worried about the impact of President Trump’s tariff actions. Since the second week of April however, it has become clear financial institutions have become acclimated to the rhetoric from the U.S White House.

The bill had looked in danger, but it was eventually pushed through both Houses of Congress. This is a win for President Trump, although the bill has been criticized as fiscally irresponsible by many on the right.Sentiment was certainly boosted by the much stronger jobs and average hourly earnings data released in the USA on Thursday, which sent stock markets soaring as the data showed a much stronger than expected economy.Although sentiment was risk-on last week, the sentiment is showing signs of slowing, and this is probably because Trump’s tariffs are now starting to come back into focus, with the coming Wednesday 9th July being Trump’s deadline for trade deals or higher tariffs, although President Trump has indicated he might extend the deadline again for at least some countries.It does seem likely that President Trump will announce the exact rates of steeper tariffs which will start to apply Wednesday from early next week, and where there are no deal or bad deals, we could see some volatility in the stock markets and currencies of those countries, as we did earlier in 2025 when Trump’s higher tariffs first started being imposed..Other market drivers last week related to certain high-impact data releases:US Average Hourly Earnings – this was expected to show a lower month-on-month increase of only 0', 'Top trades: EUR/USD, NASDAQ 100, S&P 500, Silver.

President Trump announced the following last week on tariffs:A 50% tariff on all copper imports – this sent copper futures soaring to new record highs, which will have been of interest to trend and momentum traders.A 50% tariff on Brazilian imports – this has been exacerbated by Brazil’s strong positions within BRICs and against key aspects of American foreign policy.An additional 10% tariff on all nations deemed to align with BRICs.These measures likely gave a boost to the US Dollar, which had an uncharacteristic strong week last week, and hit the Brazilian Real.
