Ultimately, I do still believe that gold goes higher over the longer term, but we still have a lot of work to do in order to break out. This time of year, is quite often very quiet, so what I am seeing now is not a huge surprise. Buying the dip continues to be the way forward.EUR/USDThe euro plunged during the beginning of the week but has found enough support just below the 1.16 level to turn things around somewhat. This is a market that’s been very bullish for a while, and therefore a bit of a pullback probably made sense. If we were to break down below the 1.15 level, then we could start to talk about a turnaround, but right now I believe we have a situation where we continue to see a lot of noisy trading, but as things stand right now, the uptrend is still very intact.NASDAQ 100The NASDAQ 100 has been bullish during the week, breaking above a neutral candlestick from the previous one.

At this point, the NASDAQ 100 means extraordinarily bullish.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewGBP/USDThe British pound has fallen pretty significantly during the trading week, to reach down toward the 1.3350 level, an area that has been important in the past, so I do believe that this is a market that is trying to find a bit of a bottom after falling apart.
