Longer-term, I fully anticipate that we are going to go toward the 24,000 level, maybe even the 25,000 level. The price action this year has been nothing short of insane, as we had a massive meltdown, only to see an even more ferocious rally. In an environment like this, it’s obvious that no matter what happens, there are people out there willing to buy this market, as it seems like every other day, we get a headline about tariffs or trade problems that could end up being negative for the markets, but they are forgotten about the next day. In other words, the buyers are very aggressive, and it looks like any correction would be welcomed as a buying opportunity.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewUltimately, this is a market that I would like to see pullback toward the 22,250 level and bounce, but I don’t even know forget that deep of a correction. Keep in mind that the 23,000 level is also important, at least from a support standpoint. Again, to the upside think we are looking to the 24,000 level, but it might need a little bit of a pullback in order to offer enough value to get big money to come in and push things higher.Ready to trade our monthly forecast?
