Source: TradingViewThe pause in crypto prices comes as concerns around Trump’s trade war and tariffs have begun to subside. Many now realize that the early numbers were designed to get trading partners to the negotiating table, which has worked for most countries except for China.While prices have stagnated, behind the scenes, speculative capital is entering the market at a feverish pace, with onchain analytics firm Glassnode reporting a surge in Bitcoin’s so-called “hot capital.”#Bitcoin's Hot Capital (sum of coins moved in the last 24h + 1d–1w) reached $39.1B on 28 Apr - its highest since 10 Feb. This metric captures short-term holder activity and is a proxy for speculative capital entering the market:https://t.co/gxCGzWzEHWpic.twitter.com/hephgPEzTx— glassnode (@glassnode)April 29, 2025As shown in the X post above, Glassnode data indicates that the sum of tokens moving over the past week hit the highest level since early February, surging by more than 90% to almost $40 billion.“Since 21 Apr, $BTC hot capital rose from $20.7B to $39.1B - an increase of $18.7B or +92%,” Glassnode said in afollow-up post. “This is one of the fastest upticks in short-term realized cap in recent months, signaling a surge in active capital turnover.”Glassnodeaddedthat BTC hot capital hit a low of $17.5B on March 23, its lowest level since December, and over the past five weeks, it has added more than $21.5B, “suggesting a rapid shift from dormancy to speculation among newer market entrants.However, despite the surge in hot capital, Glassnode says it's too early to declare the return of a full-blown bull market, as overall network participation remains low.“Signs of early FOMO are emerging, with the Hot Capital Share ticking higher and profitability metrics like Percent Supply in Profit (86%) and NUPL (0.53) expanding notably,” the firm wrote in its latestMarket Pulse analysis. “However, while on-chain activity such as transfer volume and fees are recovering, daily active addresses remain suppressed, suggesting that full organic network engagement is still rebuilding.”The report showed that futures open interest is rising, but funding rates have flipped to negative, a signal that short sellers have entered the market.“This combination of elevated leverage, aggressive short positioning, and persistent taker demand creates a fragile but explosive setup,” Glassnode said. “Should the rally sustain, short squeezes could drive a volatile extension higher; conversely, if momentum stalls, the market could see amplified swings as both sides unwind.”The report concluded by noting that while spot demand and ETF participation are materially improving, “the growing signs of FOMO and leveraged imbalance in futures suggest that volatility risks remain elevated in the short term.”At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $94,990, an increase of 1.62% on the 7-day chart.Monero Surge Linked to Bitcoin TheftMonero (XMR), a leading privacy token, was one of the top performers over the past week, spiking 43.5% on Sunday and into Monday.XMR/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe sudden surge excited privacy fans, but their enthusiasm has since been tempered by onchain sleuth ZachXBT, who said the pump was likely due to a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin, valued at $330.7 million, that may indicate a significant theft.Nine hours ago a suspicious transfer was made from a potential victim for 3520 BTC ($330.7M)Theft addressbc1qcrypchnrdx87jnal5e5m849fw460t4gk7vz55gShortly after the funds began to be laundered via 6+ instant exchanges and was swapped for XMR causing the XMR price to spike…— ZachXBT (@zachxbt)April 28, 2025ZachXBT noted that once the transfer was confirmed, the stolen stash was quickly distributed to six instant exchanges for laundering, ultimately being swapped into Monero.

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) once again led the headlines in the crypto market this week after King Crypto rallied to a new all-time high near $112,000 amid geopolitical de-risking and rising turmoil in the Japanese bond market.Data provided by TradingView shows that after stabilizing near $106,000 last Tuesday, BTC bulls charged on Wednesday to rally above $110,000, then extended their run to the new record high of $112,000 on Thursday.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewMarket watchers attributed the rally to a variety of factors, including President Trump’s announcement of Russia–Ukraine ceasefire talks on May 19, the pause of high tariffs on EU trading partners in the US, and turmoil in bond markets.In the US, the 10-Year Treasury note hit nearly 4.63%, while the US30Y hit 5.153%, its highest level since October 2023. But the real story was in Japan, where the 30-year yield on Japanese bonds reached a new all-time high of 3.185% on May 20, 2025, before retreating to 3.115% on May 23.While government bonds are typically considered safe-haven assets, the recent sharp rise in yields suggests that investor concerns around fiscal sustainability and repayment risk are rising.“Because yields are increasing, sustainability becomes more of an issue, meaning credit risk increases, meaning yields increase even more,” said André Dragosch, Head of European Research at Bitwise. “And so you end up in this kind of fiscal debt doom loop.”He suggested that the increasing volatility in Japan’s bond market may be prompting some institutional investors to reconsider Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against sovereign default risk, noting that “This is now affecting other bond markets, especially the US Treasury market.”With bond market instability rising, highlighting sovereign credit risk concerns, Dragosch underscored Bitcoin’s increasing appeal as an “immutable asset” that is “free of counterparty risk” and serves as “a hedge against sovereign risk and sovereign default.”He added that if things continue on their current track, rising yields could help push Bitcoin towards $200,000, before noting that this remains conditional on continued Bitcoin accumulation by corporations and exchange-traded fund (ETF) holders.For now, that seems likely the case. As noted in last week’s crypto update, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan and noted Bitcoin basher, announced the bank will soon allow its clients to purchase Bitcoin ETFs.But in crypto, nothing is certain. According to analysts at Bitfinex, “The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoinʼs latest breakout was a local high or the prelude to a more aggressive leg higher in Q3.”As for the altcoin market, it was another relatively quiet week as all eyes were on Bitcoin, minus a few breakout tokens. Ether (ETH), for its part, reclaimed a key technical level – the mid-line (~$2,600) of the Gaussian Channel on the 2-week chart – which has historically preceded sharp price gains and marked the start of an “altseason” across multiple market cycles in the last five years.#AltcoinsIt has finally happened.??$ETHhas reclaimed the mid-line in the 2W Gaussian Channel.Each time it managed to do so, strong rallies followed for the entire altcoin market (2021 and 2024 as an example).Altseason isn't just a meme.. it's coming ladies & gentlemanpic.twitter.com/jQx1SCXvMo— ???????ⓗ? ? (@el_crypto_prof)May 27, 2025As noted by market analyst Moustache, this development has once again rekindled expectations that an altseason is fast approaching.At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $109,070, and Ether trades at $2,645.Stablecoins Go MainstreamWhile it was largely a week of consolidation for the crypto market, the asset class – particularly stablecoins – stepped into the TradFi limelight as Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, launched an initial public offering (IPO) of 24 million shares of its Class A common stock.Stablecoins have become a hot topic in the realm of payments, and Circle’s IPO launch suggests they will continue to play an expanding role. Thus, it's not surprising that the IPO launch coincided with the launch of the Circle Payments Network (CPN) Mainnet – a blockchain-powered payments coordination protocol that allows banks and payment providers to exchange payment instructions securely and settle in real time using USDC on public blockchains.Circle Payments Network Mainnet is officially live!Today marks a major milestone for Circle, for@USDC, and for the future of stablecoin powered payments.It started as an idea, but with our first transactions already happening on CPN, it has become a reality.Cross border…pic.twitter.com/hC4ihmIPnN— Circle (@circle)May 21, 2025While the announcement may seem innocuous to some, the stakes are high in the payments space, and the competition is heating up.

Average Hourly Earnings growth was also lower than expected, at 0.2% month-on-month. After the negative Advance GDP print earlier in the week, Trump had a fairly strong case to start calling again for rate cuts, and he reiterated his call a few hours ago while stating that Fed Chair Powell is safe in his role until 2026. Trump has no real power to fire Powell anyway.Stock markets are mixed today, with Asian markets mostly higher, while US equity index futures are trading lower off-hours since markets opened this week in Asia.Bitcoinbriefly broke above the key resistance level at $95,038 but has again fallen back to trade below the big round number at $95,000.

It is widely expected that the annualized rate will remain unchanged at 2.4%, with month-on-month CPI expected to show an increase of 0.3%. If the data is higher than expected, that could boost the USD and sink US stocks; if lower than expected, the opposite will be likely.The big news yesterday was the announcement of a trade deal between the USA and China, who have been engaged in a noisy and destructive trade war since Trump took office in January. It was agreed that during an upcoming 90-day period for further negotiations, the US would drop tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China would drop tariffs on US imports from 125% to 10%. The US Dollar and US stock markets immediately jumped and held these increases, withthe NASDAQ 100 Indexup by 4.4% on the day andthe S&P 500 Indexclosing higher by 3.3%. Asian stock markets have mostly continued this rally, although Chinese indices are trading lower today. This news is likely to be bullish for global risk-on sentiment generally, including stock markets.Following yesterday's trade deal between the USA and China, markets are now expecting only 2 US rate cuts over the course of 2025, at 0.25% each, according tothe CME FedWatch tool. The first cut is not expected until September.In the Forex market, since today's Tokyo open, the Australian Dollar has been the strongest major currency, while the USD has been the weakest, puttingthe AUD/USD currency pairin focus - the Aussie typically gains when global risk sentiment improves.

It went on to make a deep retracement, shaking out many trend traders, but yesterday finally made a notably strong rise, overcoming three key resistance levels. The price has made a natural retracement but is still trading around $110,000 easily within sight of the all-time high at $112,000. If the price closes above that level at the end of the New York session today, a lot of trend traders will get back in with long positions. The best way to invest in Bitcoin over the long-term is either by buying Bitcoin directly, buying a Bitcoin future (micro futures of only 0.1 Bitcoin are available on the CME), or a Bitcoin ETF (there are several, for example BITO).Silverand the precious metalPalladiumare consolidating after making new long-term highs on Monday.

    "content": "Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewThe Fed's refusal to quicken the pace of rate cuts and the growing likelihood of regional war in the Middle East are weighing on global risk sentiment.The US Federal Reserve met last night, announcing that it will maintain its interest rate at the relatively high rate of 4.25%, as was almost unanimously expected by analysts. The most important part of the release and press conference was the emphasis that the Fed is in no hurry to cut its interest rate, despite the risk to the economy which will potentially be caused by President Trump's new tariffs and resulting retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries. This saw stocks and other risky assets taking a downturn, with the US Dollar and other safe haven assets benefiting.According tothe CME FedWatch tool, markets are still expecting two rate cuts by the Fed before the end of 2025, one in September and one in December, so this is really only a minor development.The war between Iran and Israel enters its seventh day with Israel striking hard at the Iranian nuclear program, including Isfahan and Arak, and continuing to hit regime targets. Yesterday saw President Trump forcefully reject talk of a ceasefire at the same time as three Iranian government planes were allowed by Israel to depart Iran and arrive in Oman. President Trump stated that he demanded nothing less than unconditional surrender by Iran, after which the Iranian nuclear program would be peacefully destroyed. Trump's bottom line: Iran must not develop a nuclear weapon. Stock markets rose as rumours of an Iranian desire to visit Trump circulated, but Iranian Supreme Leader angrily rejected any talk of \"groveling before the White House\". Minutes later, the US began organising to evacuate more of its citizens and assets from the region, signaling a potential escalation. On the USA getting involved in attacking Iran, Trump said \"I might do it, I might not\". Most analysts see the chance of US involvement as rising, with Israeli government officials apparently convinced it is a question of when, not if.The rate of successful Iranian missile fire on Israel had so declined that yesterday the Israeli governent ordered a reopening of workplaces provided they are located near protected areas. About an hour after dawn, Iran fired a relatively large missile barrage targeting a major hospital in Beersheva, a financial target in Ramat Gan, and a residential area near Tel Aviv. There are at least 100 wounded, several seriously. The Israeli government has responded by stating that it will increase its efforts to hit regime targets in Iran, and labelling Khamenei as a war criminal. This is somewhat of an escalation and might further weigh on risk sentiment, as President Trump has been protecting Khameini from being targeted. The price ofWTI Crude Oilis rising, looking bullish near its 4-month high.The Bank of England will be holding a policy meeting today but is not expected to cut its interest rate.The Swiss National Bank will be holding a policy meeting today and is expected to cut its interest rate from 0.25% to 0%.The Forex market is more active this morning.

Since the Tokyo open, the strongest major currency has been the Japanese Yen, while the weakest has been the British Pound, puttingthe GBP/JPY currency crossin focus.The EUR/USD currency pairhas continued to advance, reaching a new 3.5 year high above $1.1700 Friday, so trend traders will want to be long here - this currency pair has a great record of respecting its long-term trends.Canada has abolished its recent Digital Services Tax, which effectively acted as a barrier to US trade, infuriating the Trump administration. It seems clear that Canada is working hard to try to agree a comprehensive trade deal with the USA by July 21st, some time after the generic 9thJuly deadline, although Trump looks very willing to push this deadline back by a few months where the progress of negotiations warrants it.Silverremains bullish, although it is still some way off its recent high well above $37, and the precious metalPalladiumbroke to a new 6-month high last Friday.

    "description": "The US Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged amid persistent inflation and tariff-related concerns. Powell signals cautious stance with economic uncertainty ",
    "content": "The United States Federal Reserve maintained the benchmark rate at a range between 4.25% and 4.5% at Wednesday’s meeting. This comes after the Fed held rates at this level at its prior meetings in January, March and May, after cutting rates at the final three meetings in 2024. Today’s decision, which was a unanimous vote, was widely expected. The US dollar has showed little response to the Fed decision.FOMC Statement Dovish, Notes Concern about Inflation, US EconomyThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement noted that, “the unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated”. The statement added that concern about the economic outlook “has diminished but remains elevated”.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the message of the FOMC statement at his press conference, saying that “despite elevated uncertainty, the economy is in a solid position. Powell said that the labor market was in good shape and inflation had dropped significantly but was still above the 2% target.Powell: Tariffs Starting to Affect InflationPowell also discussed the US tariffs, saying that although recent inflation readings had been “favorable”, the Fed was “beginning to see some effects” of tariffs on inflation and that he expected upcoming inflation reports to reflect higher inflation as the tariffs continued to filter through the economy.US President Trump has been highly critical of Powell for not lowering interest rates but Powell has stuck to his guns. Powell again defended his position on Wednesday, saying that the Fed’s current stance leaves it “well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.”The Fed also released its “dot plot”, a chart of where each FOMC member thinks interest rates are headed. The dot plot showed members expect two interest rates in 2025 and one more cut in 2026 and 2027.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewUS Dollar, Stock Markets Shrug after Fed AnnouncementThe US dollar showed little reaction to the Fed decision. USD/JPY, EUR/USD and GBP/USD are showing limited movement on Thursday. The exception has been AUD/USD, which is down 0.49%, and NZD/USD , which has declined 0.75%. These declines are likely due to a soft Australian employment report on Thursday. US stock markets showed virtually no reaction in the aftermath of the Fed decision. The S&P 500 Index declined 1.85 points (0.03%) on Wednesday and closed at 5,980.The Nasdaq 100 Index rose 0.61 point (0.0028%) and closed at 21,719.",

    "content": "US Final GDP data released on Thursday was a disappointment, with an annualized decrease in the first quarter of 2025 of 0.5%, revised downwards from the second estimate in May of -0.2%. The downward revision was due to decreases in consumer spending, exports and government spending.The first-quarter GDP release marks a sharp reversal from Q4 2024, in which the US economy expanded 2.4% year-on-year, and this is the first time in three years that the US economy has declined.The BEA noted that the current US Dollar GDP, which does not account for the impact of inflation on the current value of GDP, increased by 3.2% year-on-year, lower than the 3.4% gain in the second estimate.The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 3.4% in the first quarter, up from 3.3% in the second estimate. Similarly, the core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy and is closely watched by the Fed, rose 3.7% in Q1, up from 3.6% in the second estimate.Thursday’s weak GDP report is a clear indication that the US economy is slowing down, but the labour market remains surprisingly resilient. Initial jobless claims, released today, dropped to 236,000, down from an upwardly revised 246,000 in the previous release and below the consensus of 245,000. If the US labor market continues to post strong numbers, market expectations for a rate cut in the next few months will increase.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewUS Dollar Loses Ground, Stock Markets Slightly HigherIn the Forex market, the US dollar has retreated against all the major currencies in the aftermath of the GDP and unemployment claims report.

There will be a release today of US Purchasing Power Index (PPI) data which is seen as another key inflation metric.In the Forex market, the US Dollar index responded to the declining chance of a 0.25% rate cut in September (currently only a 54% chance) according tothe CME FedWatch tool. This has boosted the US Dollar which has now risen for ten consecutive market days. In the wider market, since todays Tokyo open, the Australian Dollar is the strongest major currency, while the Swiss Franc is the weakest.The EUR/USD currency pairremains within a valid long-term bullish trend but yesterday traded as low as $1.1600 so any long trade here does not look very healthy right now. The European Union is considering slapping retaliatory tariffs on US imports of aircraft, vehicles, and some other goods.UK CPI (inflation) unexpectedly rose from 3.4% to 3.6% annualized.

This seems to be mostly due to optimism that the US will now strike more reasonable trade deals with other nations and trading blocs (for example the EU) after agreeing to impose a relatively low 15% tariff on Japanese auto imports earlier this week. Risk-on sentiment has certainly been boosted. It is notable that it is the broad stock market that is outperforming the tech sector, withthe NASDAQ 100 Indexfailing to approach the S&P 500's strong performance yesterday.Precious metals remain in focus although they have mostly lost some ground over the past day.

The benchmark rate has remained at its lowest level since August 2022.RBNZ statement: Uncertainty Requires CautionWhy the change in rate policy? The rate statement noted that the “economic outlook remains highly uncertain” and said that the rate path would depend on the following factors – the speed of the economic recovery, inflation and the impact of tariffs.At the same time, the RBNZ signaled that it would continue to loosen monetary policy if inflation continued to ease as the Bank has projected. The Bank released an updated inflation forecast which projected inflation moving towards the top of the Bank’s 1-3% target band in mid-2025 and easing to around 2% by early 2026 due to lower underlying inflation and spare capacity in the economy.The bottom line of the RBNZ rate decision? Today’s hold is likely a short breather rather than a change in monetary policy. The RBNZ signaled at the meeting that it plans to continue trimming rates in order to kick-start the struggling economy, assuming that the economy, and particularly inflation, evolves in line with the RBNZ’s forecasts.The New Zealand economy tipped into a recession last year and lower global demand has hurt the export-dependent economy. The markets expect at least one more rate cut before the end of the year but the rate path will largely depend on inflation and growth data.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewNew Zealand Dollar Steady, Stock Market Dips SharplyThe New Zealand dollar has shown a muted response to today’s rate decision.The NZD/USD currency pairis currently trading at 0.5993, down 0.07% on the day.

    "description": "US, Canada CPI rise in June; US hits 2.7%, core 2.9%. Tariffs blamed. Fed likely on hold. Stocks up, USD steady. Nasdaq +0.65%, S&P 500 +0.22%.",
    "content": "The markets were braced for a rebound in June inflation in Canada and the US and that’s exactly what happened today in both countries, as CPI and core CPI climbed higher.US CPI, Core CPI Hotter in JuneThe US consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-on year in June, up from 2.4% in May, matching the consensus expectation. This was the second consecutive monthly rise in inflation, which is now at its highest level since February 2025. On a month-on-month basis, CPI rose to 0.3% from 0.1% in May, the largest increase in five months and matching the consensus.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, climbed to 2.9% from 2.8% but below the consensus of 3.0%. Monthly, the core rate rose 0.3%, up from 0.1% in May and matched the consensus.The hotter June inflation numbers were most likely driven by President Trump’s tariffs, which have raised the price on most products imported into the US. The tariffs, which were first imposed in April, did not show a spike in inflation until now and we can expect upcoming that the tariffs will also be felt in upcoming inflation reports as the tariffs continue to filter through the US economy.Today’s hot inflation report means pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower rates will ease. The money markets have priced a hold at the July 30 meeting at close to 100%, although the Fed is expected to resume cutting rates in the fourth quarter.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewCanada’s CPI Hits 1.9%Canada’s inflation rate also heated up in June. CPI rose to 1.9% year-on-year, up from 1.7% in May and in line with the consensus. Inflation remained below the Bank of Canada’s target rate of 2% for a third successive month. Monthly, CPI dropped to 0.1%, compared to 0.6% in May and matching the consensus expectation. The trimmed-mean core CPI, which the BoC uses as its preferred gauge for underlying inflation, was unchanged at 3% y/y, as expected. BoC policymakers won’t be losing any sleep over headline CPI, which remains below the 2% target, but would like to see core CPI ease before delivering a rate cut.US Dollar Shows Muted Reaction, US Stock Market Edges Higher After Inflation ReportThe US dollar is showing limited in the aftermath of today’s inflation report.

    "description": "US inflation remained at 2.7% in July as core CPI rose to 3.1%, reinforcing expectations of a September Fed rate cut and lifting US stocks.",
    "content": "The US consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-on-year in July, unchanged from the June figure and below the market estimate of 2.8%. CPI remained at its lowest annual inflation rate since February 2021. Monthly CPI eased, rising to 0.2% from 0.3%, in line with market expectations. Gasoline and fuel oil prices continued to decline sharply, a key factor in easing inflation.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, moved in the opposite direction. Annual CPI climbed to 3.1% in July, up from 2.9% and above the market estimate of 3.0%. This marked the highest level in five months. Monthly, the core rate rose 0.3%, up from 0.2% and in line with the market estimate.The rise in core CPI reflects the effect of Trump's tariffs, which took effect in April and continue to filter through the economy. The tariffs are expected to dampen growth and raise inflation, as US consumers pay more for imported goods.Inflation Report Likely Cements Rate Cut in SeptemberThe Federal Reserve has been on an extended pause and hasn't lowered interest rates since December 2024. That is expected to change at the next Fed meeting, barring an extreme surprise. The markets have currently priced in a 94% likelihood of a rate cut at the Sep. 17 meeting, up sharply from 84% just before the inflation release. Investors were clearly relieved that CPI remained at 2.7% and didn't rise to 2.8% as expected, anticipating that this will clear the path for the Fed to lower rates next month.US Dollar Shows Muted Response, Stock Market Edges Higher after Inflation ReportThe US dollar is showing little reaction following the release of the US inflation report, while the US stock market is in positive territory.TheGBP/USD currency pairis trading at 1.3482, up 0.35% on the day, but most of these gains were recorded ahead of the inflation release.The US stock market has posted gains on Tuesday, as investors reacted positively to the inflation report.TheS&P 500 Indexhas climbed 26 points (0.41%) and is trading at 6399.TheNasdaq 100 Indexhas climbed 86 points (0.36%) and is trading at 23,613.",
