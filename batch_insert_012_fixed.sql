The Euro''''s losses came as investors cautiously await further clarity on upcoming US tariff measures. The European Union announced that it is making progress towards a trade agreement with the United States, aiming to prevent a significant escalation in tariffs through an initial agreement that would impose a comprehensive 10% tariff on many goods, with reduced rates for key sectors such as pharmaceuticals, alcohol, semiconductors, and commercial aircraft.However, the European Union also announced preparations for retaliatory tariffs on a range of US products in response to President Trump''''s metal tariffs. Officials warned that if an agreement is not reached, additional measures could follow, such as export controls and restrictions on US access to public contracts. Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that the broader US tariff package—initially scheduled for July 9—has been postponed to August 1.On the monetary policy front, markets now expect one more interest rate cut from the European Central Bank this year.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewTrading Advice:Be cautious about buying EUR/USD at higher levels.

Last Thursday the EUR/USD was near the 1.17900 vicinity as selling started to develop. Traders who have been anticipating reversals higher the past couple of day as the EUR/USD fell through key support levels have been disappointed and have likely taken a hit to their trading accounts.The U.S Fed last night surprised few by remaining overly cautious. The EUR/USD was near the 1.15500 juncture at one time yesterday, but continued to sell off instead of producing a fight upwards. As Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chairman, spoke yesterday the EUR/USD fell through the 1.15000 ratio. The currency pair has sustained value beneath the 1.14500 this morning.

Looking for a tide that lifts the EUR/USD at this moment may feel logical, but complex shifts of sentiment have made financial institutions nervous. Yesterday’s caution from the Federal Reserve was anticipated, but perhaps the stern cautiousness from the Fed Chairman caused more anxiety.Powell doesn’t appear ready to cut interest rates anytime soon. Powell continues to press upon the uncertainty button regarding the potential effects from tariffs. However, in the meantime the U.S GDP numbers came in better than expected yesterday and so did the GDP Price Index. U.S growth was stronger and inflation was weaker. Yet the Fed continues to worry about tariffs. The EUR/USD has sold off massively in the past we'',

    ''The EUR/USD enjoyed a solid month of upwards price action in June, and as July gets ready to start technical and fundamental traders will have their perspectives tested quickly in the coming days.As of this writing the EUR/USD is near the 1.17280 ratio, which is rather remarkable considering the starting point for the currency pair one month ago.The bullish attitudes in the EUR/USD remained strong the past handful of weeks and the currency pair is certainly testing higher realms not seen since October of 2021.Technical traders will have to likely engage with long-term charts to grow accustomed to the current values the EUR/USD is trading.USD centric weakness has been strong in Forex for a few months. Yes, the Middle East conflict which escalated on the 13th of June caused some temporary risk adverse trading, but by early last week’s ceasefire Forex resumed its negative USD outlook. There is also the factor of an outlook which believes the Federal Reserve will have to begin cutting interest rates in the mid-term which has been priced into the USD in recent weeks.Bullish Sentiment and Federal Reserve Outlook Storm CloudsHighs attained in the EUR/USD which are testing long-term values will now run into questions. The consideration that the currency pair may have become too overbought and will now face a test of choppiness due to certain factors already having been priced in are legitimate. If financial institutions have factored two interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, this could now begin to create headwinds for the EUR/USD as financial institutions consider fair market outlook.Short and near-term considerations regarding the U.S spending bill may also factor into Forex over the first week of July. While it seems likely a budget bill will eventually be passed, it might not come about easily and this could cause storms in Forex until clarity is achieved. There are also potential shadows because of the July 9th tariff deadline via the White House and negotiating n'',

The gold price index closed the week stable around $3349 per ounce, amidst a bullish market momentum that could persist until August 1st, the date set by Trump for imposing more tariffs against global economies. The return of US dollar weakness and lower Treasury bond yields allowed the gold market to recover again.The decline in the US dollar and yields coincided with cautious statements from Federal Reserve Governor Waller last Thursday evening. His comments bolstered demand for precious metals as an inflation hedge, as he expressed support for US interest rate cuts at the FOMC meeting on July 29th and 30th. Precious metals markets also received support as a safe haven from global trade tensions, following President Trump''''s announcement last Wednesday of his intention to send tariff letters to over 150 countries, notifying them that tariff rates could be 10% or 15% starting August 1st.On the economic front, strong US economic news on Friday showed optimism regarding Federal Reserve policy, while limiting gains in precious metal prices.

Japan also pledged to invest $550 million US dollars in the United States, becoming the first country to reach an agreement before Donald Trump''''s August 1st deadline for trade deals.The US-Japan agreement reportedly includes only a 15% tariff on imports from Japan, primarily in exchange for a promise from the Japanese government to invest $550 billion in the United States.

Meanwhile, US and Chinese negotiators are scheduled to meet later today in an effort to extend the current trade truce and prevent new tariffs.Also, investors are focused on the Federal Reserve’s policy announcement scheduled for Wednesday, looking for clues on future US interest rate moves.

There is what I considered to be an “inner consolidation area” between the $3300 level and the $3400 level. So, in other words, I think there are plenty of places to see a lot of noise and choppiness, and unless we put some external pressure on this market, we may very well just jump back and forth in the same range for the month. I am bullish in general, but I also recognize that we need some type of momentum to get things moving.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewAll things being equal, I do believe that eventually we could break out to the upside, but I don’t know if it will be during the month of August. If it is, then it probably means that the US dollar is falling, or perhaps there is a major “risk off” move in the markets, and gold will be used to protect wealth. I do recognize that we have been in a long-term uptrend for some time, at least until the last couple of months. This consolidation area lines up perfectly with the old adage of “sell in May and go away” that Wall Street quite often will quote. Perhaps that’s all there is, but if we were to break down below the $3000 level, then I think you’ve got a situation where gold really starts to crumble. I give that about a 15% chance, so I am still looking at short-term pullbacks as buying opportunities.Ready to trade our monthly forecast?
