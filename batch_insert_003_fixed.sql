    ''How DeFi Is Disrupting & Revolutionizing the Forex [year]'',
    ''The total value locked on RWA tokenization platforms at the time of writing is over $12 billion. This includes tokenized stocks, treasuries, and bonds. RWA tokenization adds to the list of significant DeFi innovations that are relevant to mainstream finance and the over $2.4 quadrillion Forex market.On June 30, 2025, US-based brokerage platform, Robinhood, introduced tokenized OpenAI, SpaceX, as well as 200+ additional U.S. stocks for EU users, powered by Arbitrum’s Layer 2 blockchain. According to CEO Vlad Tenev, “Crypto is the next evolution of finance.”DeFi provides self-custody alternatives to mainstream finance, including the Forex market, and garnering attention from top players in traditional finance (TradFi). In this article, we discuss DeFi, how it is disrupting the Forex market, and its future in relation to traditional Finance.What Is DeFi?DeFi is an acronym for Decentralized Finance. It defines financial solutions built on the blockchain. DeFi applications leverage blockchain and decentralized protocols to build software that can be used for operations like lending, tokenization, trading, and yield farming. DeFi applications are self-custody applications, meaning that users maintain full control of their assets while interacting with the platform. They do not rely on third parties or a central administrator to function.DeFi Primitives Relevant to Forex and TradFiDeFi primitives are the foundational principles on which decentralized finance applications are built. Here are some of the major DeFi primitives relating specifically to TradFi and the Forex market.RWA Tokenization RWA (Real World Asset) tokenization creates a representation of mainstream commodities like national currencies, real estate, company shares, stocks, bonds, and precious metals on the blockchain.Stablecoins Stablecoins are tokens pegged to the value of a fiat currency. Over $250 billion worth of USD has been minted as stablecoins on the blockchain to date.Decentralized exchanges (DE'',

    ''When I started day trading cryptocurrencies in 2022, I immediately had to incorporate key ideas and trading strategies to be successful.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewIn this article, I want to unpack the ideas that made me profitable as the cryptocurrencies swung up and down, developed trends and sometimes stayed in ranges. This knowledge and the strategies I adopted have been game-changers for me and many successful crypto traders.Let’s look at:Cryptocurrency day trading strategiesA step-by-step guideDos and Don’ts in day tradingWhat Is Crypto Day Trading?A cryptocurrency day trade involves entering a trading position in a cryptocurrency and then exiting the position in a short-term time frame, usually within the same day. For example, I buy Bitcoin at 10 a.m. and sell the position at 3 p.m. to complete a day trade.Cryptocurrency markets run 24/7 without an official opening or closing time each day. That means cryptocurrency day trading can happen at all hours of the day. The strict definition of day trading is to open and close a trading position on the same day. However, if a position remains open a little more than a day, I also classify that as day trading for the sake of this article.That means day trading has a short-term focus on immediate moves that require precise timing to catch.Why Day Trade Cryptos and Bitcoin?Liquidity and VolatilityThe best markets for day trading are those with liquidity and volatility. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are highly liquid and volatile, making them excellent for day trading.Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its market price. For an asset to be liquid, it must have a large market capitalization and plenty of trading volume. Bitcoin''''s market capitalization was over $1 trillion in February 2024 and reached over $2 trillion one year later.But there’s no point in day trading a market if it barely moves in price, n'',

    ''Forex trading has been growing rapidly in Pakistan in the last couple of years, with hundreds of traders joining in daily. However, there are always questions that new traders have in mind before getting in on the action of forex trading in Islam.Namely, these questions primarily revolve around if forex trading is legal in Pakistan and if it’s religiously approved according to Islamic law. This means that most Pakistani traders want to know if forex trading is legal according to Sharia law before they start trading.So, in this article, we will be covering all these important questions that Pakistani traders may have in mind. In addition to this, we will also be discussing the difference between unregulated and regulated brokers, so you’ll know which direction to go in before taking your first steps in forex.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewIs Forex Trading Legal in Pakistan?Let’s start with the most basic question—is it legal? The answer to that is yes, forex trading is totally legal in Pakistan.There are essentially no limits to forex trading in Pakistan. Of course, there has been some action taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) to reduce the risk of financial fraud and money laundering in the forex market. So far, we’ve covered only the legal aspect of forex trading in Pakistan.Is Forex Trading Legal According to Islamic Law?Although forex is legal according to Sharia law, there is a more complicated answer to this question. According to Islamic law, forex trading is halal as long as you keep a few important and morally-acceptable practices in mind.First of all, it is essential that you only use an interest-free forex account. As it is well known, interest is haram in Islam, and there is no exception to that rule. As such, it''''s essential to understand how Pakistan taxes forex trades.Secondly, it is important that you avoid using online forex trading as a gambling tool. This means that yo'',

    ''I’ll get right to the point: retail Forex is alive and kicking. It has plenty to offer retail traders of all experience levels, account sizes, and trading styles. I believe it will continue to do so for many generations to come. I will lay out my case for why I believe all traders should consider trading Forex.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow Retail Forex Revolutionized Retail TradingTo understand why retail Forex is alive, let’s look at how it’s revolutionized retail trading. I began trading Forex in the early 2000s. Before then, only institutions and high-net-worth individuals, usually requiring a minimum account size of $500,000, were able to trade currencies. At the time, most retail traders focused on equities and equity options, with a small proportion also trading futures contracts. When retail Forex emerged, it immediately exploded in popularity and quickly became the hot new thing.Retail traders had never seen an asset class like it, and Forex trading introduced many first experiences. For example, Forex was the first time many traders encountered leverage, and the first time they learned about over-the-counter markets that operated without centralized exchanges. In fact, because new Forex brokers advertised heavily to the public, retail Forex encouraged many to try trading for the first time.The emergence of retail Forex also helped increase the popularity of technical analysis methodology.Then, in 2005, MetaTrader 4 was introduced, specifically for Forex brokers. Before MetaTrader, most independent trading platforms required costly subscriptions or purchases. MetaTrader was free and used by almost all Forex brokers, making it immediately popular. Traders then started sharing MetaTrader trading templates (e.g., indicator settings) and automated systems (Expert Advisors), subscribing to signals and copying trades from other MetaTrader users. Suddenly, thanks to MetaTrader, many traders began collaborating'',

(''NZD/USD Eyes Resistance Before RBNZ Rate Cut'',
    ''Following the RBNZ cutting its Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 50 basis points (bps) in November 2024, economists and investors expect another bumper 50 bp rate reduction on Wednesday this week – with an outside chance of a more minor 25 bp reduction. A 50 bp (25 bp) adjustment would bring the OCR to 3.75% (4.00%). In addition, markets are also expecting another 75 bps worth of cuts this year.Sluggish Economic ActivityI’ve observed little reason to stray from market pricing and expect an additional 50 bp cut this week. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth fell into a technical recession in Q3 24 after printing a second consecutive quarter in negative territory; the -1.5% contraction was the lowest figure since Q2 20. Additionally, unemployment has risen to its highest level since late 2020 at 5.1% (Q4 24), and given inflation remains within the RBNZ’s 1-3% target band – Q4 24 inflation increased to 2.2% (matching the 2.2% print in Q3 24) – the central bank has ‘room’ to lower the OCR.With a 50 bp cut largely baked in, and assuming the central bank follows through, I expect a knee-jerk sell-off across New Zealand dollar (NZD) pairs. That said, most focus will be on any change in the rate statement’s language, press conference commentary, and any revisions in the updated economic projections.NZD/USD Vulnerable to the DownsidePrice action on the monthly timeframe for the NZD/USD (New Zealand dollar versus the US dollar) came within a stone’s throw of testing long-term support from US$0.5511 this month. Anyone following candlestick patterns may note that the current monthly candle is poised to close by way of a bullish engulfing formation. While monthly support is clear, and the bullish engulfing pattern indicates buyers may want to explore higher terrain, the rebound in October 2022 failing to print a meaningful high may concern long-term bulls. Couple this with the overall long-term trend facing south, and any higher rebound could be short-lived.This brings me to the daily'',

    ''South Africa recognizes Forex trading as a legitimate activity, and the South African Revenue Services (SARS) requires South African residents to pay taxes on Forex trading profits. In short, all South African residents must declare their Forex profits for tax purposes, and there is no getting around it. Like most nations’ revenue-collecting services, SARS will impose penalties for not paying taxes.Let’s look at how SARS taxes Forex trading and explore some tax planning strategies that Forex traders can use.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow Are Forex Trading Profits Taxed in South Africa?Forex trading profits are subject to regular income tax rates in South Africa (unless an individual has set up a company for their Forex trading). Taxpayers can deduct trading-related expenses (e.g., computer equipment, trading courses, software, etc.) from their Forex profits to reduce their taxable income.SARS publishes the applicable “tax rates for individuals” here on its website. Individual tax rates are a progressive system with higher percentages at higher income levels. The lowest tax rate is 18%, and the highest is 45% above a specified income level. Each year, SARS adjusts the income levels for each percentage income tax rate.The Provisional Tax payment system applies to Forex trading profits because trading is not a salaried activity under the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax-paying system. Let’s examine how the Provisional Tax system works.What Is Provisional Tax?Forex trading gains are subject to the SARS “provisional tax” payment method.Although “provisional tax” sounds like a separate tax type, like income tax, or inheritance tax it is not. Instead, it is a method of spreading tax payments to SARS over the year instead of in one annual lump sum at the end of the tax year. SARS uses the provisional tax payment system to even out cash flow for taxpayers, rather than facing them with a large single payment at the end of the ye'',

    ''Markets have been roiled by US President Trump’s announcement of strong new tariffs on all trading partners, followed by a 90-day suspension. How this process plays out will be key to the future of the markets over 2025 and probably beyond.1. The Trump administration is committed to implementing tariffs.2. The administration is willing to enforce tariffs at levels that match the rhetoric.I believe this second realization, i.e., the sheer levels of the tariffs the U.S. was willing to enact, was the primary catalyst that caused much of the global equity markets’ sell-off in early April 2025.The proposed tariff levels are massively uneven among nations, depending on the Trump administration’s view of how specific nations contribute to a trade deficit. Negotiations between world leaders and Trump’s team are happening at a pace that alters the landscape daily.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewWhere We Stand NowAt the time of writing, Trump paused global reciprocal tariffs for 90 days from April 9, with one notable exception: China. His pause followed days of equity and bond markets'''' sell-off that could have led to a financial meltdown, and the U.S. public would have widely considered Trump responsible in such an event. In my mind, Trump’s team underestimated the market decline and loss of public support that would follow the tariff announcements, hence the abrupt pause.However, the Trump administration will seemingly continue a baseline 10% tariff on most nations that started on April 5. Had it not been for the extra tariffs and market volatility, this alone would be a headline news item.The exception for China is stark. Currently, the U.S. has set a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, and China has retaliated with an 84% tariff on U.S. goods—numbers that would have been unthinkable a week ago. The U.S. is in a trade war with China, with neither country wishing to back down, and neither country has an off-ramp. This is uncharted t'',

    ''What is the US30?US30 is a common ticker name for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The DJIA is a major stock average in the USA which is always composed of 30 publicly traded companies listed on US stock exchanges.The DJIA has been around for a long time. It was first created as an indicator to gauge the state of the American stock market in the late 19th century. However, it has been somewhat overtaken by broader, more modern stock indices such as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100 indices. In particular, the S&P 500 Index has taken the DJIA’s old role as the barometer of the American stock market.The DJIA is price weighted, unlike modern stock indices, which are weighted by market capitalisation.The DJIA’s member companies are typically old “blue chip” companies which are involved in industrial processes, and as such, is somewhat less relevant to the modern American economy, which has become increasingly service based since the 1960s.What Is One Pip Change in US30?A pip change is the measurement used for change amounts within an exchange rate of a currency pair. It’s calculated from the last decimal point. Most major currency pairs are priced to within four decimal places, so the smallest change could be 1/100 or one percent (0.0001), which is one basis point.However, currency crosses for the Japanese Yen (EUR/JPY) have a pip of 0.01. For metals like silver and gold, a pip is 0.01 on the US30.Here’s an example: the GBP/USD moves from 1.3935 to 1.3936, so there is one pip change. If you’re using a five-digit broker and the GBP/USD moves from 1.39355 to 1.39360, there’s a half a pip change (0.5 pip).Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewHow to Measure Pips in BTC/USD on US30When measuring pips for BTC/USD pairs on the US30, it’s similar to when you’re trading gold - XAU/USD.
