(''Crude Oil Monthly Forecast: August 2025 (Chart)'',
    ''The Light Sweet Crude Oil market has been back and forth during the month of July, much like many other markets.After all, we are in the quietest time of year, with perhaps the exception of the holiday season, and although summer is typically bullish for oil, it’s difficult to get overly excited about the market right now because I think a lot of people are worried about the excess supply that OPEC continues to probe into the market.Furthermore, we also have to keep in mind that although there is a lot of demand for crude oil this time of year, there are a lot of questions when it comes to the global trade situation, which of course has been upended by the tariffs coming out of the United States. As long as that’s going to be the case, I think you have a situation where there is a certain amount of uncertainty, but as things stand right now, this is simply a market that I think a lot of short-term traders are attracted to, mainly due to the fact that there is nothing really moving at the moment.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewTechnical AnalysisThe technical analysis for this pair is very sideways, with the $65 level underneath offering support, and the $70 level above offering resistance. It’s quite common for oil markets to trade in $5 or even $10 increments, and that’s exactly what’s going on here. We recently had seen a lot of volatility due to the war between the Israelis and the Iranians, but as that calmed down, we saw the market collapse right back into the $65 region, an area that previously had been resistance. This of course launched a certain amount of “market memory” to come into play, so it makes perfect sense that we have bounced from there a couple of times.If we were to break down below the $64 level, then I think the crude oil market is in trouble. Conversely, if we were to break above the $70 level, then it’s likely that the crude oil market launches toward the $73 level, where we currently find the'',

    ''Ether (ETH) price rallied toward $4,000 at the week-open on Monday, a level not seen since December 2024, fuelled by hopes of increasing crypto regulatory clarity and persistent spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows.The largest altcoin by market capitalization is up more than 30% in the last seven days and 56% month-to-date, to hit a 7-month high at $3,825 on Bitstamp on July 21. Its trading volume has jumped 66% to $8 billion over the last 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the demand side activity.Ethereum''''s performance comes on the heels of a busy “Crypto Week” in the US and is backed by increasing network activity and persistent spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows.Favorable Regulatory Action Boosts ETH PriceThe recent surge in Ethereum’s price, which saw it climb to within a hair''''s breadth of $4,000, has been significantly influenced by the US "Crypto Week," a period marked by heightened legislative and market activity surrounding cryptocurrencies.Last week saw three key pieces of crypto legislation passed by the US House of Representatives, with the GENIUS Act set to establish a federal framework for stablecoins. This has sparked optimism across the crypto market, with Ethereum leading the charge among altcoins.Posts on X and web reports highlight a confluence of factors, including a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment anticipated under a new administration.For instance, the Financial Times reported that US President Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order allowing 401(k) accounts to invest in cryptocurrencies, signalling a shift toward mainstream acceptance.Ethereum breaks out with strongest rally in weeks, outpacing BTC and Solana as “global stablecoin adoption prompts central banks to fast-track crypto frameworks,” said a crypto investor Azeezaht Adeola in a July 17 post on X, adding:“Crypto Week heats up as the US House greenlights final votes on big crypto laws.”This legislative momentum has bolstered invest'',

    ''The gains in ETH/USD accomplished the past two and half weeks have been astounding. Ethereum began trading in July around the 2,300.00 ratio, on the 8th of July ETH/USD had gained but in a very polite fashion as it dabbled with the 2,600.00 level. That is not a bad gain for any asset. However, as of this writing Ethereum is around 3,775.00 with lightning quick price action.On the 15th of July ETH/USD was around the 2,900.00 level when a buying surge began to be seen and by the 17th, Ethereum was challenging the 3,700.00 ratio. It is important to point out that in early December and into mid-December of 2024, ETH/USD was trading above 4,000.00. And on the 7th of April Ethereum was back to 1,400.00 approximately.Forewarned and Speculatively AttractiveEthereum clearly continues to deliver a bang for the dollar via wagers on speculative direction. ETH/USD reached a high of about 3,950.00 just a couple of days ago. Since Monday’s high ETH/USD has essentially gone sideways and is straddling the 3,700.00 to 3,800.00 vicinity. Speculators who want to wager on Ethereum cannot be blamed, but they need to understand the price velocity and dangers that lurk if things go wrong.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewAs for the reason that Ethereum has rocketed higher in the past few weeks, there is talk about a surge in the DeFi sector once again for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum as a backbone of the cryptocurrency world within exchanges and as component of other digital assets infrastructure is important. However, while influencers hail the surge higher in price, it is good to remember we have been here before only to watch ETH/USD collapse.Talk of the 4,000.00 Level Again in ETH/USDAs the month of August gets ready to start and having witnessed ETH/USD gain substantially in July, traders who are bullish will certainly look upon 4,000.00 as a target. This may be completely legitimate, but for day traders timeframes will be very important.Th'',

As previously mentioned, the EUR/USD pair will remain bullish due to selling pressure on the US dollar due to the US Federal Reserve''''s policy interventions, along with growing US financial concerns.In Europe, investors have been assessing a wave of inflation data from the region''''s largest economies and their implications for the European Central Bank''''s (ECB) policy path. According to economic calendar data, consumer price inflation in Germany unexpectedly fell to 2.0% in June from 2.1% in May, returning to the ECB''''s target for the first time since October 2024 and defying expectations for a rise to 2.2%. In contrast, inflation in France, Italy, and Spain rose slightly, although it remained relatively subdued. Adding to the cautious sentiment, German retail sales recorded a sharp decline. Despite these mixed signals, money markets continue to price in an ECB terminal rate of approximately 1.75% – 1.80%.

EUR/USD Technical Analysis Today: Ahead of anticipated new statements from US Central Bank Governor Jerome Powell today, Tuesday, July 22, 2025, the EUR/USD currency pair attempted to move above the 1.1700 resistance, recovering from its recent losses that pushed it towards the 1.1556 support level by the end of last week''''s trading. The Euro''''s stability comes as investors await the European Central Bank''''s (ECB) monetary policy decision and closely monitor trade developments between the EU and the United States. On the monetary policy front, the European Central Bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged next Thursday after eight consecutive cuts, with policymakers adopting a wait-and-see approach amid uncertainty about the impact of higher-than-expected US tariffs and the strong Euro on European growth and inflation. Meanwhile, EU envoys are preparing to meet this week to discuss emergency measures in case no agreement is reached with US President Donald Trump, whose stance on tariffs appears to have hardened ahead of the August 1st deadline. The technical forecasts for EUR/USD still indicate that the currency pair is moving within a counter-bearish channel, supported by its move below the 1.1600 support level. With the gains at the start of the week, the 14-day RSI (Relative Strength Index) has returned to around a reading of 56, moving away from the midline, which gives bulls renewed momentum to push higher.

The currency pair''''s gains have been amplified by a breakthrough in resolving the US-EU trade dispute. Therefore, it is expected that a resolution to this "war" could deprive the Euro of the fuel needed to continue its ascent against the dollar. This is evident in mid-week currency price movements, as investors feel we are in the final phase of a rapid and turbulent period of global trade reordering orchestrated by US President Donald Trump. According to forex currency market trading, the Euro''''s price fell against all its G10 currency counterparts after Trump welcomed a new trade agreement with Japan, a country he had long accused of enjoying an unfair trade advantage over the United States.Details include a 15% tariff on Japanese imports, as well as various other measures by Japan to help boost imports from the United States.

The agreement has drawn strong criticism from France, while others – including German Chancellor Merz – have emphasized the potential negative impact on European exporters and, consequently, on economic growth.
