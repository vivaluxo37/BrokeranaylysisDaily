    ''Ripple Labs initiated its business in 2012 under the name of Opencoin. XRP has been traded with solid volume since it started to make formal agreements with financial institutions. Ripple Labs started with the promise of providing its users a revolutionary payment protocols system for banking transactions with quicker times to settle the transfer of funds at cheaper costs.The value of XRP/USD has been very volatile since 2017. My Ripple price prediction for 2025 sees the coin trading between $1.15 and $8. By the year 2030 Ripple could be valued between $6 and $15. These forecasts are based on market sentiment and the utilitarian capabilities of Ripple via its XRP coin.The XRP/USD coin’s primary use is making the clearing of funds easier for financial institutions and businesses associated with them. XRP/USD not a ''''standard'''' cryptocurrency like many of its major counterparts, the distributed ledger from Ripple is internal. Ripple Labs coding is ‘open source’, but XRP/USD uses a centralized system in which Ripple controls the allocation of the XRT coins, sometimes to the dismay of its skeptics.The fact that XRP/USD is centralized has become not only a ‘concern’ for many cryptocurrency influencers, but has also created a legal argument with the SEC. The Security Exchange Commission has in essence declared they believe the XRT coin is a ‘secured asset’, which would mean it has legal oversight domain. An official lawsuit was initiated by the SEC in December of 2020 against Ripple Labs and some of its executives. A contested fight within the U.S court system is anticipated.Is Ripple Undervalued?Ripple''''s XRP coin does not have an unlimited supply. The initial minting of XRP coins was said to be 100 billion. The current price of XRP/USD is near $0.67 cents. In early April 2021, XRP/USD was trading within sight of $2.00 as the broad cryptocurrency market enjoyed a heightened state of exuberance.The fall to its current price level has XRP/USD testing important support values'',

    ''Litecoin HistoryLitecoin entered the world of cryptocurrency with a rather impressive start when digital assets began to find favor with speculators and investors throughout the globe. There was a time when LTC/USD was rated within the top 5 of cryptocurrency market capitalizations as its proponents argued positively regarding its merits compared to the likes of Bitcoin. This caused a groundswell of support as people asked what the price of Litecoin would be several years in the future.Litecoin was essentially created in 2011. However the digital asset began trading in earnest with wide market interest in 2017 like many of its major counterparts, when cryptocurrencies jumped into the spotlight as their speculative gains caught the attention of the financial media. Like the other major cryptocurrencies, LTC/USD essentially went from a speculative asset few had ever heard of in early 2017 with a value of little more than nothing, to a digital asset that achieved a high price above $400 per coin in December that same calendar year. However, Litecoin then suffered a large fall in value over the coming year in line with the broader cryptocurrency market.Litecoin compared to Bitcoin was held up as a faster cryptocurrency regarding the ability to ‘mine’ its blockchain, and its transactional ability was also hailed as faster than Bitcoin, and these elements remain true to this day for the decentralized digital asset. However, not everything has been wine and roses for Litecoin early adapters, speculators and investors. Litecoin, like all cryptocurrencies, has enjoyed days of highs and extreme lows as technical and market behaviors have frequently caused storms.At the time of writing in August 2021, LTC/USD has gone through the whirlwind of its spring 2021 surge and slump like most of the major cryptocurrencies. The month of August certainly produced a rather nice climb for Litecoin, but prior to this bullish trend, LTC/USD suffered steep losses and saw lows just above $100'',

    ''Australian billionaire Andrew Budzinski, 49, founded the renowned Australian CFD and Forex broker IC Markets. He was 2024’s 65th wealthiest Australian, with a net worth of A$2.71 billion, and faces two separate lawsuits that could cost him hundreds of millions of dollars if he is found liable.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewThe secretive, little-known billionaire and IC Markets face a class action lawsuit for pocketing A$1+ billion in profits and dividends on the back of heavy losses by the broker’s retail traders. An additional lawsuit charges Budzinski with violating Fair Work policies by berating staff using homophobic slurs, threatening to withhold salaries, and sacking the entire Australian office. The question is, do the lawsuits hold merit, and what might the outcomes mean for the Australian and global retail trading industries?The second lawsuit, about Fair Work violations, targets the character of Budzinski in allegations made by a former disgruntled employee targeting Finohelp Support Pty Ltd., a support services company that assisted IC Markets with payroll. So, I will not dive into what may or may not have occurred, as it has no direct impact on CFD and Forex traders in Australia. The class action lawsuits should concern Australian-resident traders, however, as they could open the gates for more counter-productive regulatory changes, pushing Australia further behind competitive alternatives.What Should You Know Before We Look at The Allegations?Between 70% and 90% of retail traders lose money, which has less to do with leverage maximums and more to do with a lack of market education, discipline, and knowledge. Regulators cannot force traders to acquire the necessary knowledge to trade more profitably, or to use proper risk management, or comprehend the relationship between risk management, position sizing, and leverage. So, they lower the maximum leverage as a blunt regulatory tool. This gives the illusion'',

This knowledge and the strategies I adopted have been game-changers for me and many successful crypto traders.Let’s look at:Cryptocurrency day trading strategiesA step-by-step guideDos and Don’ts in day tradingWhat Is Crypto Day Trading?A cryptocurrency day trade involves entering a trading position in a cryptocurrency and then exiting the position in a short-term time frame, usually within the same day. For example, I buy Bitcoin at 10 a.m. and sell the position at 3 p.m. to complete a day trade.Cryptocurrency markets run 24/7 without an official opening or closing time each day. That means cryptocurrency day trading can happen at all hours of the day. The strict definition of day trading is to open and close a trading position on the same day. However, if a position remains open a little more than a day, I also classify that as day trading for the sake of this article.That means day trading has a short-term focus on immediate moves that require precise timing to catch.Why Day Trade Cryptos and Bitcoin?Liquidity and VolatilityThe best markets for day trading are those with liquidity and volatility. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are highly liquid and volatile, making them excellent for day trading.Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its market price. For an asset to be liquid, it must have a large market capitalization and plenty of trading volume. Bitcoin''''s market capitalization was over $1 trillion in February 2024 and reached over $2 trillion one year later.But there’s no point in day trading a market if it barely moves in price, n'',

I began trading Forex in the early 2000s. Before then, only institutions and high-net-worth individuals, usually requiring a minimum account size of $500,000, were able to trade currencies. At the time, most retail traders focused on equities and equity options, with a small proportion also trading futures contracts. When retail Forex emerged, it immediately exploded in popularity and quickly became the hot new thing.Retail traders had never seen an asset class like it, and Forex trading introduced many first experiences. For example, Forex was the first time many traders encountered leverage, and the first time they learned about over-the-counter markets that operated without centralized exchanges. In fact, because new Forex brokers advertised heavily to the public, retail Forex encouraged many to try trading for the first time.The emergence of retail Forex also helped increase the popularity of technical analysis methodology.Then, in 2005, MetaTrader 4 was introduced, specifically for Forex brokers. Before MetaTrader, most independent trading platforms required costly subscriptions or purchases. MetaTrader was free and used by almost all Forex brokers, making it immediately popular.

How this process plays out will be key to the future of the markets over 2025 and probably beyond.1. The Trump administration is committed to implementing tariffs.2. The administration is willing to enforce tariffs at levels that match the rhetoric.I believe this second realization, i.e., the sheer levels of the tariffs the U.S. was willing to enact, was the primary catalyst that caused much of the global equity markets’ sell-off in early April 2025.The proposed tariff levels are massively uneven among nations, depending on the Trump administration’s view of how specific nations contribute to a trade deficit. Negotiations between world leaders and Trump’s team are happening at a pace that alters the landscape daily.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewWhere We Stand NowAt the time of writing, Trump paused global reciprocal tariffs for 90 days from April 9, with one notable exception: China. His pause followed days of equity and bond markets'''' sell-off that could have led to a financial meltdown, and the U.S. public would have widely considered Trump responsible in such an event. In my mind, Trump’s team underestimated the market decline and loss of public support that would follow the tariff announcements, hence the abrupt pause.However, the Trump administration will seemingly continue a baseline 10% tariff on most nations that started on April 5. Had it not been for the extra tariffs and market volatility, this alone would be a headline news item.The exception for China is stark. Currently, the U.S. has set a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, and China has retaliated with an 84% tariff on U.S. goods—numbers that would have been unthinkable a week ago. The U.S. is in a trade war with China, with neither country wishing to back down, and neither country has an off-ramp. This is uncharted t'',

(''How Market Volatility Affects Execution'',
    ''Volatility is a hot topic for financial educators, traders, and investors. If you are unfamiliar with the term, it refers to a scenario where market prices rapidly rise and drop within a very short period. Depending on their trading or investing style, some skilled or even professional traders may actively avoid or choose to trade during volatility. Although potential rewards may be more significant during volatility, the risk increases exponentially.Although there is no direct correlation between volatility and execution, trying to open a trade while prices are moving rapidly can lead to price differences between what a trader expects and what they get. It’s like trying to hit a rapidly moving target with a ball, something that’s relatively challenging. In the best-case scenario, your trade may open at a more beneficial rate. In the worst-case scenario, your trade opens at a rate that causes unforeseen losses or yields a smaller return than intended.Exness helps traders mitigate this by filling their orders at the best market price available at the given moment. Thanks to a robust infrastructure of strategically located servers worldwide, their order execution* is both fast and reliable.What causes volatility?Several factors fuel volatility, but in simple terms, it occurs when traders are unsure about an event, news item, or political occurrence that will affect the markets. Here’s a more specific breakdown of these factors.NewsInformation can come from any source, but as long as it reaches an audience of market participants likely to spread market-moving news, that information can have an impact. These include traditional financial media like Forbes, Bloomberg, and the Wall Street Journal, as well as social media and trading communities like those on Discord.GeopoliticsDuring the beginning of 2025, the new US administration waffled on tariffs. The enacted ones triggered retaliatory tariffs from the targeted countries, resulting in volatility as markets feared a ra'',

Tradewill Global LLC has been serving traders worldwide through its web-based trading platform under the name “Tradewill,” while its mobile app community is more widely recognized as “Trade W.” To address this disparity and strengthen brand consistency, it has decided to consolidate all operations and communications under the single, unified brand — Trade W. Yuan Zhang, Head of Branding and Marketing at Tradewill Global LLC. says “We found that while some users recognize us as Tradewill on the web, our app community overwhelmingly knows us as Trade W. By unifying our brand as Trade W and introducing a fresh, modern logo, we aim to simplify user experience, improve brand recall, and reinforce our identity as a modern, user-focused trading platform.” As part of this rebranding initiative, Trade W will now serve as the unified brand name across all platforms — including the official website, mobile app, and all communication channels. This alignment ensures brand consistency and strengthens recognition at every user touchpoint. Furthermore, a sleek, redesigned logo has been introduced, symbolizing Trade W’s ongoing commitment to innovation, clarity, and growth.

In this sense, cost-efficiency isn’t just about low fees — it’s about the structural integrity of the entire trading experience.This is where PrimeXBT stands out. With low fees, a transparent pricing model, and a stable, high-performance platform, it delivers cost efficiency by design. Its VIP Tiers program plays a central role in that structure — helping traders save more when they trade.What traders often overlookWhile most traders pay attention to headline fees like commissions or taker rates, many of other costs live in the background.Latency, the time it takes for a trade to execute, can quietly affect entry and exit points.Slippage, the difference between expected and actual execution price, becomes especially costly in volatile markets.Spread widening during news events or low-liquidity periods can inflate the cost of a trade well beyond what was anticipated.Platform overload is when a platform lags or freezes during high-activity moments, the result isn’t just frustration — it''''s a missed opportunity.These aren’t hypothetical scenarios. For active traders, they’re part of the daily reality — and they add up.That’s why low fees alone aren’t enough — and experienced traders know it. Some platforms advertise “zero commission” models but quietly make up for it with wide spreads, restricted access to tools, or hidden charges. Others place essential features behind paywalls or limit asset access unless higher account types are unlocked.How PrimeXBT is built differentlyPrimeXBT addresses the hidden friction points of trading with infrastructure built for speed, stability, and c'',

As of January 20, 2025, opening and renewing protected accounts with maturities of six and 12 months will be stopped, according to a statement by the central bank. The statement also explained that this step aims to reduce the protected deposit program, which was launched in December 2021 to support the stability of the Turkish lira and reduce dollarization.

The Central Bank continues to intervene amidst the sharp fluctuations witnessed in global markets due to statements by US President Donald Trump, ranging from passing tariff increases to postponing them for 90 days. Consequently, these fluctuations have widened a wave of intense foreign capital outflows. During the period between March 14th and 28th, outflows of 14 billion dollars were recorded from foreign investment portfolios.According to data published on X, the Turkish Central Bank injected approximately 10.7 billion dollars from its foreign currency reserves in just two days, distributed between 7.6 billion dollars on April 7th and 3.1 billion dollars on the 8th of this month.
