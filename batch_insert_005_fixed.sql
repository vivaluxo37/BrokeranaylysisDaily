    ''Trading fees are often accepted as part of the cost of trading — a necessary friction in an otherwise fluid market. But for serious traders, these costs are more than incidental — they’re a performance lever.However, the true cost of trading goes beyond visible charges. It’s embedded in the structure behind each trade — from slippage and spread behavior to platform reliability under pressure. In this sense, cost-efficiency isn’t just about low fees — it’s about the structural integrity of the entire trading experience.This is where PrimeXBT stands out. With low fees, a transparent pricing model, and a stable, high-performance platform, it delivers cost efficiency by design. Its VIP Tiers program plays a central role in that structure — helping traders save more when they trade.What traders often overlookWhile most traders pay attention to headline fees like commissions or taker rates, many of other costs live in the background.Latency, the time it takes for a trade to execute, can quietly affect entry and exit points.Slippage, the difference between expected and actual execution price, becomes especially costly in volatile markets.Spread widening during news events or low-liquidity periods can inflate the cost of a trade well beyond what was anticipated.Platform overload is when a platform lags or freezes during high-activity moments, the result isn’t just frustration — it''''s a missed opportunity.These aren’t hypothetical scenarios. For active traders, they’re part of the daily reality — and they add up.That’s why low fees alone aren’t enough — and experienced traders know it. Some platforms advertise “zero commission” models but quietly make up for it with wide spreads, restricted access to tools, or hidden charges. Others place essential features behind paywalls or limit asset access unless higher account types are unlocked.How PrimeXBT is built differentlyPrimeXBT addresses the hidden friction points of trading with infrastructure built for speed, stability, and c'',
