The following press conference saw the Euro and Pound soar for an hour or two before falling back and giving up much of their earlier gains, so there seems to have been nothing from the ECB that caused a sustained change. Although the GBP/USD and EUR/USD price charts look quite bullish, the US Dollar Index chart is suggestive of a major bullish reversal (see below) so some caution here might be wise.The Bank of Canada left rates unchanged, so there was no surprise there, and the Loonie barely reacted to this meeting.Last week’s most important data releases were:US Non-Farm Payrolls and Average Hourly Earnings – NFP came in a bit above estimates, at 139k new jobs, while Average Hourly Earnings increased by 0.4% month-on-month, and that latter number is a high, key metric which the Fed watches.Eur',

However, all that changed in the early hours of Friday in the Middle East as news broke of a very strong Israeli strike on Iran’s key military figures and its nuclear materials and scientists. This sent markets into a risk-off direction.The Israeli strike has led to what could be described as all-out war between Israel and Iran, with Iran firing powerful ballistic missiles at Israeli population centers, and Israel in turn hitting hard at the military, the nuclear program, and increasingly at Iranian oil facilities.This war has been long awaited, and it seems clear that the Israeli attack was acquiesced in by the Americans, who so far at least are not helping with offensive actions, although they are likely assisting in Israel’s strong antimissile defense, which is continuing to intercept over 90% of projectiles. However, the missiles which get through cause serious damage and fatalities, although at a level the Israeli public can probably accept, at least for a few more days or weeks.It seems clear that the Iranian regime and nuclear program is in serious jeopardy, the nuclear program more so, and Iran has a limited supply of perhaps 2,000 ballistic missiles that it may not be able to replenish. The big question is whether the Americans will join in the drive to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, or whether Iran might sue for a negotiated settlement that would be acceptable to the USA.Th',

It looks very much like a victory for Israel and the USA.The USA claims that the strikes have been completely successful. The International Atomic Energy Agency has stated that it can find no increase in radiation levels from these facilities following the strikes.Al Jazeera is reporting that Iranian technicians spent the past three days removing materials from the key Fordow plant. Whether this is a significant development or not remains to be seen, but there is plenty of jubilation, or at least quiet relief, throughout the Middle East, Europea, and the USA today.The Iranian government is now also claiming that enriched uranium was removed from Fordow before the attack. One might consider that given the capabilities already demonstrated by Israel and the USA, that these countries are likely to have a good idea where it is now.Although the Iranian regime has issued blood-curling threats, pledging that no US citizen will be safe anywhere (a clear war crime if ever there was one, to add to its targeting of Israeli civilian buildings with cluster munitions last week), its response so far has been limited to a relatively small (45) missile barrage on Israel, which does not seem to have caused any fatalities.

Both Israel and the Trump administration have been quite belligerent, threatening to resume bombing if Iran acts to rebuild its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. The scale of the victory will certainly tilt the dynamics of the Middle East towards Israel and the USA, with the Trump administration hinting that further countries, possibly even including Syria, will shortly be joining the Abraham accords, i.e. making a formal peace with Israel.The aftermath of the war has seen risk assets, especially in the USA, increase in value, with major US stock market indices like the NASDAQ 100 and the S&P 500 breaking out to new all-time high prices, which is usually a very bullish sign.This bullish environment is interesting as it contradicts some economic data we got this week and what the Federal Reserve is saying, not to mention the 9th July Trump tariff deadline which is just around the corner.Jerome Powell, Chair of the Fed, has now led investors to expect three further rate cuts this year of 0.25% each, up from two.Final GDP data for the USA came in notably worse than expected, suggesting a recession might even be possible.Turning to the 9th July tariff deadline, the USA has concluded only two trade deals, meaning that if more deals are not inked over the next 10 days, the US will impose much higher tariffs on many countries.

    'The Light Sweet Crude Oil market has been back and forth during the month of July, much like many other markets.After all, we are in the quietest time of year, with perhaps the exception of the holiday season, and although summer is typically bullish for oil, it’s difficult to get overly excited about the market right now because I think a lot of people are worried about the excess supply that OPEC continues to probe into the market.Furthermore, we also have to keep in mind that although there is a lot of demand for crude oil this time of year, there are a lot of questions when it comes to the global trade situation, which of course has been upended by the tariffs coming out of the United States. As long as that’s going to be the case, I think you have a situation where there is a certain amount of uncertainty, but as things stand right now, this is simply a market that I think a lot of short-term traders are attracted to, mainly due to the fact that there is nothing really moving at the moment.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewTechnical AnalysisThe technical analysis for this pair is very sideways, with the $65 level underneath offering support, and the $70 level above offering resistance. It’s quite common for oil markets to trade in $5 or even $10 increments, and that’s exactly what’s going on here. We recently had seen a lot of volatility due to the war between the Israelis and the Iranians, but as that calmed down, we saw the market collapse right back into the $65 region, an area that previously had been resistance. This of course launched a certain amount of “market memory” to come into play, so it makes perfect sense that we have bounced from there a couple of times.If we were to break down below the $64 level, then I think the crude oil market is in trouble.

This has sparked optimism across the crypto market, with Ethereum leading the charge among altcoins.Posts on X and web reports highlight a confluence of factors, including a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment anticipated under a new administration.For instance, the Financial Times reported that US President Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order allowing 401(k) accounts to invest in cryptocurrencies, signalling a shift toward mainstream acceptance.Ethereum breaks out with strongest rally in weeks, outpacing BTC and Solana as “global stablecoin adoption prompts central banks to fast-track crypto frameworks,” said a crypto investor Azeezaht Adeola in a July 17 post on X, adding:“Crypto Week heats up as the US House greenlights final votes on big crypto laws.”This legislative momentum has bolstered invest',

Trading remained between the 1.1654 support level and the 1.1698 resistance level, settling around 1.1667 at the beginning of today''s trading session on Tuesday.

The pair has now returned to strong trendline support, as shown in the chart, which confirms that the continuous uptrend since February has seen upward and downward fluctuations, but the weakness has always been less profound than the previous upward surges. Certainly, a drop below the illustrated trendline does not mean the end of the trend, but it may mean a longer period of consolidation before its eventual re-launch, requiring more patience from those who may target a move towards the psychological resistance of 1.20.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewCurrently, some weakness is evident from the chart, which also shows that the EUR/',

The Euro''s gains intensified as investors assessed comments from European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers following the Eurozone''s inflation rate reaching the ECB''s 2% target.Speaking at the ECB Forum on Central Banking, ECB President Christine Lagarde welcomed the June inflation data, which came in as expected, but cautioned about "two-sided risks" stemming from increasing economic fragmentation and escalating geopolitical tensions. At the same time, other ECB officials indicated that interest rates are likely to remain stable at this month''s meeting, after eight consecutive deposit rate cuts since June 2024. This caution is amid ongoing concerns about global trade tensions, instability in the Middle East, and the Euro''s recent strength.The single European currency also found support from a weaker US dollar, as markets continue to anticipate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts despite uncertainty surrounding the impact of tariffs imposed by US President Trump.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewTrading Tips:We advise monitoring EUR/USD selling levels rather than considering buying in hopes of further gains.Will the EUR/USD pair reach the 1.20 level?According to forex market experts, the EUR/USD trend remains positive; the medium-term trend is still upward and optimistic, as we''ve observed a multi-mont',

Sell EUR/USD from the resistance level of 1.1750 with a target of 1.1520 and a stop loss of 1.1830. EUR/USD Technical Analysis Today: Ahead of anticipated new statements from US Central Bank Governor Jerome Powell today, Tuesday, July 22, 2025, the EUR/USD currency pair attempted to move above the 1.1700 resistance, recovering from its recent losses that pushed it towards the 1.1556 support level by the end of last week''s trading. The Euro''s stability comes as investors await the European Central Bank''s (ECB) monetary policy decision and closely monitor trade developments between the EU and the United States. On the monetary policy front, the European Central Bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged next Thursday after eight consecutive cuts, with policymakers adopting a wait-and-see approach amid uncertainty about the impact of higher-than-expected US tariffs and the strong Euro on European growth and inflation. Meanwhile, EU envoys are preparing to meet this week to discuss emergency measures in case no agreement is reached with US President Donald Trump, whose stance on tariffs appears to have hardened ahead of the August 1st deadline. The technical forecasts for EUR/USD still indicate that the currency pair is moving within a counter-bearish channel, supported by its move below the 1.1600 support level. With the gains at the start of the week, the 14-day RSI (Relative Strength Index) has returned to around a reading of 56, moving away from the midline, which gives bulls renewed momentum to push higher.

This comes with a clear break from the pair''s recent bearish reversal, which tested the 1.1556 support level last week. The currency pair''s gains have been amplified by a breakthrough in resolving the US-EU trade dispute. Therefore, it is expected that a resolution to this "war" could deprive the Euro of the fuel needed to continue its ascent against the dollar. This is evident in mid-week currency price movements, as investors feel we are in the final phase of a rapid and turbulent period of global trade reordering orchestrated by US President Donald Trump. According to forex currency market trading, the Euro''s price fell against all its G10 currency counterparts after Trump welcomed a new trade agreement with Japan, a country he had long accused of enjoying an unfair trade advantage over the United States.Details include a 15% tariff on Japanese imports, as well as various other measures by Japan to help boost imports from the United States.
