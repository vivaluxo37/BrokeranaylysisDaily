('Weekly Pairs in Focus - May 25 - May 30, 2025 (Charts)', 'USD/CADThe US dollar has plummeted against the Canadian dollar during trading this past week, as we are now testing the crucial 1.3750 level. The 1.3750 level is an area that is very important, and at this point in time, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of volatility and potential support, but at this point, I would need to see the US dollar recapture the 1.39 level to begin to think about buying against the Canadian dollar, despite the fact that there is still no trade agreement between the 2 economies.Crude OilThe crude oil markets have been all over the place during the week, as we tested the $65 level but then turned around to show signs of hesitation. The $60 level seems to be offering support, and if we can stay above that level, then I think you’ve got a real opportunity to go back and forth on short-term chart. I think that’s probably the most likely turn of events, but Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs being recommended against the European Union starting June 1, and that could be negative for oil, only time will tell. If we can recapture the $65 level on a daily close, then I think crude oil can rally quite nicely.USD/JPYThe US dollar fell rather significantly during the trading week against the Japanese yen, and now that we have more chaos involving tariffs, it’s possible that we could see the Japanese yen continue to strengthen. This flies in the face of the interest rate situation, and at this point in time I am fairly neutral about this pair. I believe there is a ton of support between current levels in the ¥140 level, so I am looking for stability and a turnaround to start buying. If we were to break down below the ¥140 level, that would be extraordinarily negative.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThis might be one of the more interesting pears this week, as the United States and the European Union are about to ratchet up tensions as far as tariffs are concerned.

With that being said, it’s probably worth noting that we are seeing hesitation above the $3.400 level for the 3rd week in a row. This doesn’t necessarily mean that gold is going to fall apart, but I do think we have some work to do to get moving. That being said, you should also keep in mind that the US and Chinese delegates meet this weekend.GBP/USDThis is one of the most interesting charts for me on the weekly timeframe in the world of forex. Quite frankly, we are struggling mightily to break above the 1.34 level, and the fact that we are finishing the week with a candlestick that looks a lot like a shooting star, and preceded by 2 actual shooting stars, tells me that we are on the precipice of a potential strengthening of the US dollar. By contrast, if we can break above the 1.35 level, the British pound could soar at that point, perhaps picking up another 500 pips. Nonetheless, it’s worth noting that there are several charts starting to hint that the US dollar is potentially going to make a comeback.USD/CADThis is one of those charges I was speaking about. The engulfing candlestick on the weekly chart suggest that buyers have stepped in and started buying the greenback against the Canadian dollar in mass. This makes sense, as Canada still does not have a trade deal with its most important trading partner, the United States. By extension, this means that the Canadian economy is going to remain under pressure, and therefore I think we will see the greenback continue higher.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThis is an interesting chart as well, as we have seen market participants go in both directions all week, as we tested the 1.12 level at the very lows, but have since bounced quite nicely.

That being said, the €23,500 level looks to be a significant support level as we have bounced nicely from there, and ultimately, I think we have a situation where the market has recently broken above significant resistance, and it’s likely that we will continue to see buyers on each and every dip. I suspect at this point the DAX will go looking to the €25,000 level.USD/JPYThe US dollar initially fell during the week against the Japanese yen, but the ¥145 level has offered support. All things being equal, this is a market that continues to see a lot of volatility, but there are a lot of buyers underneath that will continue to come into the market and choose the US dollar due to the interest rate differential, as the Bank of Japan has absolutely no real chance of tightening anytime soon. Meanwhile, bonds are selling off in the United States, driving yields higher.GoldGold has had a tough week, but it looks as if we are closing just below the crucial $3200 level. The $3200 level of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area that a lot of people would be watching very closely. After all, it has served as support and resistance multiple times, and of course we are in the middle of a massive rally overall. With this being the case, I do suspect that if we can recapture the $3200 level, then it is possible that the gold market starts reaching toward the upside yet again.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewBitcoinBitcoin has a pretty choppy week but ultimately ended up settling on a fairly unchanged turn of events.

This is an area that I think attracts a lot of attention, mainly due to the fact that we had bounced so significantly from there previously. That being said, the market is closing below the $60 level, so we do need to be somewhat cautious at this point in time. All things being equal, this is a market that I think will continue to see a lot of volatility as traders are worried about demand. Ultimately, this is a sideways market at the moment, leading to the downside.GoldThe gold market initially tried to rally for the week but then fell rather hard. It’s interesting to see that the gold market is falling while the stock market is rallying. We have had a major negative correlation between gold and stocks as of late, so I’m paying close attention to the $3200 level, and then again, I would be watching at the $3000 level for some type of bounce that I can start buying again.AUD/USDThe Australian dollar has a positive week, as we are now breaking above the 50 Week EMA. By doing so, the market looks as if it is ready to continue going higher, perhaps looking to the 200 Week EMA near the 0.67 level. Ultimately, this is a market that is probably getting some benefit from the idea of China quietly looking for a trade deal with the United States, which would have a major influence on the Australian economy as they are a major supplier of raw materials for China and of course the overall economic engine that drives the rest of the world as far as manufacturing is concerned.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThe euro has been all over the place during the course of the week, as we continue to look for some type of directionality.

However, the July deadline remains for trade deals and this issue will heat up again as July approaches.Beyond that, although not especially significant, the major events of last week were the slightly hawkish rhetoric from Jerome Powell, Fed Chair, about an elevated risk of inflation requiring rates to be kept higher for longer, and the Bank of England’s widely expected 0.25% rate cut.

Tehran and Tel Aviv had agreed to a temporary ceasefire after exchanging strikes since last week. However, reports of fresh missile launch, and strike orders raised scepticism about the truce''s validity and fuelled concerns that the conflict would soon resume.Furthermore, this occurred after the exchange of controlled strikes between Iran and the United States minimized collateral damage and preceded a period of apparent de-escalation.

All things being equal, the “market memory” should come into the picture, but if we break down below that level, then I think the British pound might find itself in a little bit of trouble.

The market breaking above the $65 level is a very positive sign, so I will be watching that this week. A move above could open up a move to the $68 level, possibly even the $72.50 level. Underneath, we have a massive amount of support near the $60 level, so as long as we can stay above there, I still think there are plenty of buyers in this market as the US economy is stronger than the market had been pricing in previously, if the jobs numbers are to be believed.NASDAQ 100The NASDAQ 100 rallied for the week, breaking above the 21,800 level, and threatening overall highs near 42,100.

This of course has people running toward safety currency such as the US dollar, so it does make sense that we have seen hesitation. However, earlier in the week we had seen quite a bit of bullish pressure, so one would have to assume that there is at least some demand out there for the euro. I suspect the next couple of weeks will be very violent but may have a bit of a bid for them.USD/MXNThe US dollar spent most of the week falling against the Mexican peso, but turned around after the airstrikes, and because of this we are sitting right at the 200 Week EMA. We are also at the crucial 19 MXN level, so if we were to bounce from here it would make a certain amount of sense, but I see a lot of resistance near the 19.40 MXN level, so whether or not it is going to truly rally remains to be seen, I think that could be an area where we could see some issue. A break above the 50 Week EMA could send this pair to the 20 MXN level.GBP/USDThe British pound has been all over the place during the week, as we continue to see a lot of questions asked of the US dollar. That being said, after the airstrikes on Friday, we have seen a little bit of a pushback against risk-taking, so it’ll be interesting to see how this plays out.
