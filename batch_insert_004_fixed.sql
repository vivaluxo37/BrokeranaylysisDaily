    ''Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are tipped as the most significant monetary shift in 50 years, since the US left the gold standard in 1971. As of 2025, 137 countries, making up 98% of global GDP, are engaged in researching, developing, and piloting national CBDCs.Governments are racing to launch digital currencies into their economies to avoid being left behind in an industry predicted to reach $213 billion in transaction volume by 2030.In the article, you’ll learn why countries are launching CDBCs, how China’s e-CNY is leading the way, and the challenges facing central banks in their quest for digital transformation.What is a CBDC?A Central Bank Digital Currency or ‘CDBC’ is a digital form of a sovereign nation''''s legal currency. Most often, they are blockchain-based cryptocurrencies that are issued and controlled by governments or central authorities. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, a government-issued CDBC is legal tender and can be used for payments of goods or services.The concept of CDBCs is still relatively new, and very few nations have actually launched this new style of digital money. Most countries are still developing, testing, and piloting CDBCs, but they are likely to be officially implemented with increasing speed over the coming years.While the architecture is still being designed, most will rely on a two-tier system where a country''''s central bank issues the coins, and commercial banks are responsible for distribution. CBDCs rely on blockchain technology to deliver 24/7, instant settlement, while smart contracts enable deeper levels of financial automation.Motivations for CBDC AdoptionA big attraction for governments is the traceability and transaction history recorded on a blockchain network. This provides complete traceability for ‘digital cash’ compared to traditional notes and coins, which are not traceable.Centralized control is a significant factor in the distinction between CDBCs and traditional cryptocurrencies.

(''How Market Volatility Affects Execution'',
    ''Volatility is a hot topic for financial educators, traders, and investors. If you are unfamiliar with the term, it refers to a scenario where market prices rapidly rise and drop within a very short period. Depending on their trading or investing style, some skilled or even professional traders may actively avoid or choose to trade during volatility. Although potential rewards may be more significant during volatility, the risk increases exponentially.Although there is no direct correlation between volatility and execution, trying to open a trade while prices are moving rapidly can lead to price differences between what a trader expects and what they get. It’s like trying to hit a rapidly moving target with a ball, something that’s relatively challenging. In the best-case scenario, your trade may open at a more beneficial rate. In the worst-case scenario, your trade opens at a rate that causes unforeseen losses or yields a smaller return than intended.Exness helps traders mitigate this by filling their orders at the best market price available at the given moment. Thanks to a robust infrastructure of strategically located servers worldwide, their order execution* is both fast and reliable.What causes volatility?Several factors fuel volatility, but in simple terms, it occurs when traders are unsure about an event, news item, or political occurrence that will affect the markets. Here’s a more specific breakdown of these factors.NewsInformation can come from any source, but as long as it reaches an audience of market participants likely to spread market-moving news, that information can have an impact. These include traditional financial media like Forbes, Bloomberg, and the Wall Street Journal, as well as social media and trading communities like those on Discord.GeopoliticsDuring the beginning of 2025, the new US administration waffled on tariffs. The enacted ones triggered retaliatory tariffs from the targeted countries, resulting in volatility as markets feared a ra'',
