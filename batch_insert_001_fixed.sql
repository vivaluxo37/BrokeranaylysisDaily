It explains the fundamentals of momentum trading, describes two primary types of strategies ("Best of" and “Time Series”), and discusses the pros and cons of each approach. Additionally, the article offers practical tips for implementing momentum strategies across various asset classes, including Forex and stock indices, while highlighting the key considerations traders should be aware of when using this method.What is Momentum TradingMomentum trading is a trading strategy that calls for buying or selling assets based on their historical price performances. It is a purely technical strategy depending entirely upon technical analysis of historical time series price data.The basic idea is that assets whose price has been going up are worth buying, on the belief that the price will continue to rise, while assets whose price has been going down are worth selling on the belief that the price will continue to fall.Momentum trading is a continuation strategy, not a reversal strategy.Momentum traders will decide upon a “universe” of tradable assets, and the criteria for determining when any of them are exhibiting strong enough momentum suitable for a trade entry.Momentum Trading Strategies - TypesThere are basically two types of momentum trading strategies:“Best of” Momentum Trading StrategiesHere, the trader monitors their universe of assets, and will look to go long of the asset or assets which are showing the strongest bullish momentum, and short of the asset or assets which are showing the strongest bearish momentum.For example, let’s suppose that a momentum trader builds a universe of the following tradable assets:This momentum trader uses a “best of” momentum strategy where at the start of each yearly quarter, he or she measures the performances of these assets over the previous quarter, and for the followin'',

    ''I mistakenly did not think about taxes at the beginning of my trading career in the UK. This led to some preventable errors, and I want to help others avoid the same mistakes. In this article, I will give a comprehensive overview, presenting all the key information in one place, covering:whether all forex traders pay taxes in the UKUK tax classification according to the HMRCincome tax, corporation tax, and capital gain taxstrategies to reduce taxable incomea forex trading tax exampledetermining tax statusreporting and filing requirementsLet’s begin.Understanding Forex Trading Taxes in the UKLike all countries, the UK has tax rules that its residents should follow religiously. The UK’s tax-collecting authority, HM Revenues and Customs (HMRC) does not take kindly to people not paying their taxes. It seeks to recover unpaid taxes, impose fines, and sometimes pursue criminal proceedings. That is not a road anyone would wish to travel down.Do All Forex Traders Pay Taxes in the UK?I get asked this question most often, so let’s address it now. There are several scenarios where traders do not pay taxes on their trading profits:Everyone can make up to £1000 annually in trading profits without paying taxesSpread betting, as opposed to Contracts for Difference (CFDs), is tax-free so long as the HMRC does not view your trading as your profession (i.e. for example, trading regularly and making most of your income from it). The tax-free status of spread betting is mainly why people are drawn to it compared to CFDs.Individuals have a capital gains tax allowance (the Annual Exempt Amount) each tax year, allowing them to pay no tax on capital gains up to this level. The Annual Exempt Amount for the 2024/25 tax year is £3,000.UK Tax Classification According to the HMRCThree tax categories can apply to traders: Capital Gains, Income, and Corporation Tax.Capital Gains Tax (CGT)This is the most common tax CFD and Forex traders pay.
