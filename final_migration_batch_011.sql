('EUR/USD Monthly Forecast: July 2025 (Chart)', 'The EUR/USD enjoyed a solid month of upwards price action in June, and as July gets ready to start technical and fundamental traders will have their perspectives tested quickly in the coming days.As of this writing the EUR/USD is near the 1.17280 ratio, which is rather remarkable considering the starting point for the currency pair one month ago.The bullish attitudes in the EUR/USD remained strong the past handful of weeks and the currency pair is certainly testing higher realms not seen since October of 2021.Technical traders will have to likely engage with long-term charts to grow accustomed to the current values the EUR/USD is trading.USD centric weakness has been strong in Forex for a few months. Yes, the Middle East conflict which escalated on the 13th of June caused some temporary risk adverse trading, but by early last week’s ceasefire Forex resumed its negative USD outlook. There is also the factor of an outlook which believes the Federal Reserve will have to begin cutting interest rates in the mid-term which has been priced into the USD in recent weeks.Bullish Sentiment and Federal Reserve Outlook Storm CloudsHighs attained in the EUR/USD which are testing long-term values will now run into questions. The consideration that the currency pair may have become too overbought and will now face a test of choppiness due to certain factors already having been priced in are legitimate. If financial institutions have factored two interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, this could now begin to create headwinds for the EUR/USD as financial institutions consider fair market outlook.Short and near-term considerations regarding the U.S spending bill may also factor into Forex over the first week of July. While it seems likely a budget bill will eventually be passed, it might not come about easily and this could cause storms in Forex until clarity is achieved. There are also potential shadows because of the July 9th tariff deadline via the White House and negotiating n', 'Broker Analysis', '2025-07-23T00:00:00', 'Forex', ARRAY['forex', 'currency analysis', 'forecast', 'monthly outlook'], 'eurusd-monthly-forecast-july-2025-chart', 'EUR/USD nears 1.1730 in July 2025 after a strong June rally.

Longer-term, I fully anticipate that we are going to go toward the 24,000 level, maybe even the 25,000 level. The price action this year has been nothing short of insane, as we had a massive meltdown, only to see an even more ferocious rally. In an environment like this, it’s obvious that no matter what happens, there are people out there willing to buy this market, as it seems like every other day, we get a headline about tariffs or trade problems that could end up being negative for the markets, but they are forgotten about the next day. In other words, the buyers are very aggressive, and it looks like any correction would be welcomed as a buying opportunity.EURUSD Chart by TradingViewUltimately, this is a market that I would like to see pullback toward the 22,250 level and bounce, but I don’t even know forget that deep of a correction. Keep in mind that the 23,000 level is also important, at least from a support standpoint. Again, to the upside think we are looking to the 24,000 level, but it might need a little bit of a pullback in order to offer enough value to get big money to come in and push things higher.Ready to trade our monthly forecast?

Ultimately, I do still believe that gold goes higher over the longer term, but we still have a lot of work to do in order to break out. This time of year, is quite often very quiet, so what I am seeing now is not a huge surprise. Buying the dip continues to be the way forward.EUR/USDThe euro plunged during the beginning of the week but has found enough support just below the 1.16 level to turn things around somewhat. This is a market that’s been very bullish for a while, and therefore a bit of a pullback probably made sense. If we were to break down below the 1.15 level, then we could start to talk about a turnaround, but right now I believe we have a situation where we continue to see a lot of noisy trading, but as things stand right now, the uptrend is still very intact.NASDAQ 100The NASDAQ 100 has been bullish during the week, breaking above a neutral candlestick from the previous one. At this point in time, the market is very bullish, and we have hit a fresh, new all-time high, and therefore I think we’ve got a scenario where the just simply need to see some type of reason to continue the upward trajectory. Pullbacks at this point in time are still very possible, with the 22,250 level being a significant level on the charts that will almost certainly offer a bit of support on any dip.

If we were to break above that level, then it’s likely that the market will just simply continue the overall long trend. That being said, we have recently seen a massive jump higher, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we have spent this time consolidating. This is especially true, considering that the time of year is fairly quiet for a lot of markets to begin with.CopperCopper had another explosive week, as we continue to get trade headlines, and of course traders start to price in the idea of copper being a major component of artificial intelligence, so this is a different market that was just a few years ago. The market is very strong, but we also gave back quite a bit of the gains late in the week, so I think this is a situation where you probably look for dips to continue buying copper from a longer-term standpoint with particular interest paid to the $5.50 level, and then the $5.20 level.SilverSilver initially rallied during the week but got absolutely clobbered near the $40 level. The resulting candlestick is a very ugly shooting star, but it’s worth noting that the previous 2 candlesticks were a large, explosive, positive candlestick, followed by a hammer. In other words, there is a lot of noise in this area, and I think you continue to see a lot of back and forth trading more than anything else. With that being the case, the market is just simply trying to sort out whether or not we have enough momentum to go higher.

Somewhere in that general vicinity, I would love to see a pullback, followed by a bounce that I can start buying. That being said, if we break down below the $6000 level, then things might be changing. However, I suspect that you will know that some type of external pressure is being applied to the market, and therefore you can just simply trade according to the overall risk appetite sentiment.However, the market bouncing the way it has from the beginning of April suggest that there are plenty of buyers out there willing to get involved, even if we are a little overdone. To the upside, I would anticipate that the $6500 level could be a bit of a target, and if we can break above there then I think buyers will jump in and try to take advantage of the overall uptrend. I have no interest in shorting the market, at least not until we break down below the $6000 level, and even then, I would need to have an actual reason.

This range has already absorbed several profit-taking events this week, proving its importance for short-term stability.If price breaks below this level, the next area of interest is $802–$805, a pivot zone marked by prior consolidation.Resistance is building at $860–$865.

Since hitting a record high above $123,000 on July 14, Bitcoin (BTC) entered a period of consolidation, largely holding above $118,000, before world events helped bears drive the price of King Crypto to a low of $111,940 on August 3.Since then, bulls have taken control, stair-stepping BTC back above $119,000 to hit a high of $122,290 on Monday, and are looking poised to push into uncharted territory.BTC/USD 1-day chart.
