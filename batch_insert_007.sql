This week, the price reached a new peak at 35.42 lira, amid expectations of continued rise in the pair in light of the current shift in monetary policy. The Central Bank of Turkey approved the first interest rate cut in December by 250 basis points. This cut is considered a shift in the monetary policy that has been tightened for more than a year and a half, by raising the interest rate starting from mid-2023 to levels of 50% before stabilizing for several months until last December.Data-wise, the Turkish Statistical Institute announced a 3.1% decrease in exports in November compared to the same month last year, with exports reaching $18.29 billion.

Concurrently, Most estimates indicate that the interest rate will be held steady after the bank cut the interest rate by 250 basis points in the December meeting.Previously, the Turkish Central Bank had announced new steps within the framework of its strategy to reduce the "protected deposit accounts against foreign exchange fluctuations" program, as part of the gradual shift towards more traditional economic policies. As of January 20, 2025, opening and renewing protected accounts with maturities of six and 12 months will be stopped, according to a statement by the central bank. The statement also explained that this step aims to reduce the protected deposit program, which was launched in December 2021 to support the stability of the Turkish lira and reduce dollarization. The program, which guaranteed depositors protection against exchange rate fluctuations, was criticized for its high cost and negative impact on the budget.

Recently, the Central Bank of Turkey has adopted a strategy aimed at enhancing the attractiveness of the Turkish lira to investors by offering high returns. Obviously, this strategy is based on allowing the lira to depreciate against the dollar but ensuring that the rate of depreciation is less than the inflation rate. Furthermore, this approach aims to reduce the impact of currency weakness on rising prices.Over the past year, the lira has depreciated by 16% against the dollar in nominal terms. However, when taking inflation into account, the lira recorded significant gains, the best since 2007. This policy provided a unique opportunity for foreign investors, as they could achieve returns of over 50% by investing in Turkish lira bonds, making it one of the most attractive options in the financial markets.At the same time, the report indicated an improvement in the value of the lira, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan'',

Meanwhile, the dollar price in Turkey recorded record levels during the past weekend after the pair rose to 36.53 lira levels. While it recorded 36.40 levels at the time of writing the report. The current rise pattern of the pair reflects the extent of the monetary and financial authorities'''' control in Turkey over the lira''''s movements, which are declining in a limited and similar pattern daily. Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated during the weekend that the Central Bank''''s reserves recorded their highest level ever after exceeding 173 billion dollars, while his country''''s share of the global economy rose to about 1.1% compared to the 0.7% recorded previously. It is mentioned that the high interest rates in the country have attracted a large segment of interest investors, which supported the rise in the country''''s monetary reserve. In terms of'',

This is an area that’s been important a couple of times in the past but at this point in time it looks like it is still going to be thought of as a target. If we can break above there, then the market is likely to continue to go higher, perhaps opening up a move to the $35.50 level. Short-term pullbacks should continue to be potential buying opportunities in this market, as it obviously has a lot of underlying upward pressure. I don’t think things change very quickly.GoldGold markets continue to be very noisy, and it is worth noting that we did sell off during the day on Thursday, but quite frankly I think this is a market that any time we get some type of decent pullback, people will be willing to step in and pick up “cheap gold.” I believe that the $3200 level underneath is a significant support level, as it was significant previously, and then after that we have the $3000 level that could offer a bit of a short-term floor as well. After all, there is a large, round, psychologically significant aspect of that level.WTI Crude OilThe West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil market has a definite air of positivity under it, with the $60 level offering support. The market looks as if it is going to try to get to the $65 level sooner rather than later, and if we can break above there, it’s very possible that the WTI Crude Oil market could break even higher than that, perhaps making a run toward the $70 level.

    ''USD/JPYThe US dollar initially fell against the Japanese yen but has found enough support near the 140 level to turn things around and bounce quite significantly. It’s interesting, because the 140 level has been a major support level going back some time now, and it’s also worth noting that the 200 Week EMA sits there as well. By forming this massive hammer, and the fact that some of the rhetoric out there has gone off the rails, it’s starting to look more and more like the US dollar is in the process of bottoming. Furthermore, the Japanese yen looks like it is giving up some of that strength.USD/CHFThe US dollar initially fell during the course of the week to break down below the 0.81 level, only to turn around and bounce all the way toward the 0.83 level. The US dollar looks like it is ready to rally from here, but whether or not it can change the overall trend is a completely different question. If we can break above the 0.84 level, then I think we have a situation where we could rise as high as 0.8750 level. However, if we turn around a breakdown below the weekly candlestick, then we could drop to the 0.80 level eventually.GBP/USDThe British pound has rallied significantly during the course of the week, but it found the 1.34 level to be far too resistant to continue. By doing so, we ended up forming a bit of a shooting star. This is a market that is overbought, so a pullback makes quite a bit of sense at this point in time. In fact, I am seeing this across the board when it comes to the US dollar, so I think all things are leading to the same scenario, where the greenback is suddenly going to strengthen. That being said, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the British pound will fall apart, just that we have certainly gotten too far ahead of ourselves. However, if we were to break above the 1.34 level on a weekly close, we could really start to accelerate to the upside.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewEUR/USDThere are'',

The Central Bank continues to intervene amidst the sharp fluctuations witnessed in global markets due to statements by US President Donald Trump, ranging from passing tariff increases to postponing them for 90 days. Consequently, these fluctuations have widened a wave of intense foreign capital outflows. During the period between March 14th and 28th, outflows of 14 billion dollars were recorded from foreign investment portfolios.According to data published on X, the Turkish Central Bank injected approximately 10.7 billion dollars from its foreign currency reserves in just two days, distributed between 7.6 billion dollars on April 7th and 3.1 billion dollars on the 8th of this month. This brings the total amount spent by the Turkish government since the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu on March 19th to about 42.7 billion dollars, in an attempt to contain the deterioration of the'',

Negotiations will be ongoing until the 90-day period ends in early July.The big news last week was the European Central Bank’s rate cut of 0.25%, which was widely expected, and the optimism that inflation is now well on course to settle long-term at about the target level of 2%. The ECB seems to feel quite confident that it has inflation beaten, and ironically this may be boosting the Euro as a new safe-haven currency.Another major item was lower than expected inflation in both the UK and in Canada, which is adding to the growing “inflation beaten” narrative.The Bank of Canada held its Overnight Rate at 2.75%.US Retail Sales data came in a little stronger than expected.Finally, President Trump has been publicly criticizing Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting rates more quickly, and is publicly musing on studying replacing him, although it is hard to see how this could be executed.
