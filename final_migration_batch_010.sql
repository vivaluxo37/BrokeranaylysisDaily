According to performance across gold trading platforms, selling pressure increased as a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran reduced demand for safe-haven assets, led by gold. Gold prices moved lower after US President Donald Trump announced on Monday that both countries had agreed to a full ceasefire, adding that Iran would begin the truce immediately, followed by Israel 12 hours later.Trump''''s comments came shortly after Iran conducted a symbolic retaliatory strike on a US military base in Qatar, though no casualties were reported.On the central banking policy front, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman stated that she would support a US interest rate cut in July if inflationary pressures remain under control, echoing recent dovish remarks by Governor Christopher Waller. Investors are now looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell''''s testimony before the US Congress later today and tomorrow, Wednesday.

That being said, the market has pulled back just a bit, but I think we still see plenty of support near the ¥142 level, and I do think that we might be in the midst of a bottoming pattern. Furthermore, we are starting to see the US dollar stiffen it’s resolve against the basket of major currencies that we typically followed. In other words, we may be in the middle of turning things around.GBP/USDThe British pound initially did try to rally during the course of the week but gave back gains. All things being equal, the market looks as if it is going to be watching the crucial 1.35 level, as it is a major support level, based on the fact that it has been a major resistance barrier. All things being equal, the “market memory” should come into the picture, but if we break down below that level, then I think the British pound might find itself in a little bit of trouble. On the other hand, if we can break above the 1.3650 level, the British pound could really start to take off.DAXThe German index did rally a bit during the course of the week, but it is starting to show signs of hesitation around the €24,000 level. At this point, the market might be a little bit overbought, and while we broke above a major resistance barrier, we got there so quickly that I think a little bit of sideways action probably makes a certain amount of sense.

We are currently in the middle of a lot of choppy behavior, and I think we have a situation where market participants will have to look at this from a short-term perspective more than anything else, as we look like we are trying to find a reason to continue the overall uptrend but just do not have it at the moment.WTI Crude OilThe WTI Crude Oil market had a very strong week, breaking toward the crucial $65 level. The market breaking above the $65 level is a very positive sign, so I will be watching that this week. A move above could open up a move to the $68 level, possibly even the $72.50 level. Underneath, we have a massive amount of support near the $60 level, so as long as we can stay above there, I still think there are plenty of buyers in this market as the US economy is stronger than the market had been pricing in previously, if the jobs numbers are to be believed.NASDAQ 100The NASDAQ 100 rallied for the week, breaking above the 21,800 level, and threatening overall highs near 42,100. All things being equal though, the market is a little bit extended, and I think we may see some choppy behavior as we try to push through the major swing high that we had melted down from.

This of course has people running toward safety currency such as the US dollar, so it does make sense that we have seen hesitation. However, earlier in the week we had seen quite a bit of bullish pressure, so one would have to assume that there is at least some demand out there for the euro. I suspect the next couple of weeks will be very violent but may have a bit of a bid for them.USD/MXNThe US dollar spent most of the week falling against the Mexican peso, but turned around after the airstrikes, and because of this we are sitting right at the 200 Week EMA. We are also at the crucial 19 MXN level, so if we were to bounce from here it would make a certain amount of sense, but I see a lot of resistance near the 19.40 MXN level, so whether or not it is going to truly rally remains to be seen, I think that could be an area where we could see some issue. A break above the 50 Week EMA could send this pair to the 20 MXN level.GBP/USDThe British pound has been all over the place during the week, as we continue to see a lot of questions asked of the US dollar. That being said, after the airstrikes on Friday, we have seen a little bit of a pushback against risk-taking, so it’ll be interesting to see how this plays out. Ultimately, I think we have a scenario where traders will be looking at this through the prism of risk appetite, and right now we are currently trading in a range between the 1.34 level on the bottom and the 1.3650 level on the top.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewAUD/USDThe Australian dollar traders have seen the market go back and forth during the course of the week as we continue to watch the 0.6550 level as a massive barrier.

Ultimately, we are just simply sitting in the middle of the range at approximate “fair value”, so now we need another catalyst. Ultimately though, I prefer the upside.NASDAQ 100The NASDAQ 100 is slightly positive for the week, but ultimately this is a situation where we are consolidating as well, with the 22,000 level as a major resistance barrier. If we can break above there, the market could take off to the upside and really, I think we’ve got a situation where we have just simply a bit of consolidation, as we have rocketed far too quickly to the upside.

('Weekly Pairs in Focus - June 29 - July 05, 2025 (Charts)', 'CL/WTIThe Light Sweet Crude Oil market fell rather hard during the course of the week, as the Iranians and Israelis signed a cease-fire. This of course has taken some of the “risk premium” out of the market for crude oil, as tensions in the Middle East seem to be slowing down a bit. Because of this, I think you have a situation where traders simply got rid of those “panic longs”, as we had gotten far too ahead of ourselves. With this being the case, range bound trading is more likely than not going to be where we go from here.GoldGold markets have fallen rather significantly during the course of the week, and I think what we have is a situation where a lot of the “risk premium” coming out of the gold trade has had a major influence. That being said, now that the situation in the Middle East has calmed down, I think we will focus on things like central bank buying, the idea that the Federal Reserve is going to cut later this year, and of course the overall momentum trade. Because of this, traders will more likely than not look at any dip as a potential buying opportunity, especially near the crucial $3200 level.SilverSilver has had yet another back and forth type of trading week, and it looks to me like traders are going to continue to look at this as a market that needs to work off some of the excess froth from the previous shot higher, with the $35.50 level offering significant support. If we were to break to the upside, pay close attention to the $37.50 level, because it is an area that could offer support going forward as it is now resistant. Any move above opens up the possibility of $40. At this point, I look at this is a market that is likely to either go sideways or break out to the upside.

However, the missiles which get through cause serious damage and fatalities, although at a level the Israeli public can probably accept, at least for a few more days or weeks.It seems clear that the Iranian regime and nuclear program is in serious jeopardy, the nuclear program more so, and Iran has a limited supply of perhaps 2,000 ballistic missiles that it may not be able to replenish.

Its trading volume has jumped 66% to $8 billion over the last 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the demand side activity.Ethereum''''s performance comes on the heels of a busy “Crypto Week” in the US and is backed by increasing network activity and persistent spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows.Favorable Regulatory Action Boosts ETH PriceThe recent surge in Ethereum’s price, which saw it climb to within a hair''''s breadth of $4,000, has been significantly influenced by the US "Crypto Week," a period marked by heightened legislative and market activity surrounding cryptocurrencies.Last week saw three key pieces of crypto legislation passed by the US House of Representatives, with the GENIUS Act set to establish a federal framework for stablecoins. This has sparked optimism across the crypto market, with Ethereum leading the charge among altcoins.Posts on X and web reports highlight a confluence of factors, including a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment anticipated under a new administration.For instance, the Financial Times reported that US President Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order allowing 401(k) accounts to invest in cryptocurrencies, signalling a shift toward mainstream acceptance.Ethereum breaks out with strongest rally in weeks, outpacing BTC and Solana as “global stablecoin adoption prompts central banks to fast-track crypto frameworks,” said a crypto investor Azeezaht Adeola in a July 17 post on X, adding:“Crypto Week heats up as the US House greenlights final votes on big crypto laws.”This legislative momentum has bolstered invest', 'Broker Analysis', '2025-07-23T00:00:00', 'Cryptocurrency', ARRAY['cryptocurrency', 'digital assets'], 'ethereum-price-rallies-30-during-crypto-week', 'Ethereum surged 30% during “Crypto Week,” approaching $4,000 as ETF inflows, corporate accumulation, and regulatory optimism drove bullish momentum.', 'published', '2025-08-21T16:38:51.341172', '2025-08-21T16:38:51.341180'),

The pair has now returned to strong trendline support, as shown in the chart, which confirms that the continuous uptrend since February has seen upward and downward fluctuations, but the weakness has always been less profound than the previous upward surges. Certainly, a drop below the illustrated trendline does not mean the end of the trend, but it may mean a longer period of consolidation before its eventual re-launch, requiring more patience from those who may target a move towards the psychological resistance of 1.20.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewCurrently, some weakness is evident from the chart, which also shows that the EUR/', 'Broker Analysis', '2025-07-23T00:00:00', 'Forex', ARRAY['forex', 'currency analysis', 'technical analysis'], 'eurusd-analysis-1507-us-inflation-figures-lower-chart', 'EUR/USD trades near 1.1667 as traders await US CPI and German ZEW.
