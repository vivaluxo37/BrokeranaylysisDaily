The parent company opted to maintain Degiro as a separate entity within its group of companies. Each client opening a Degiro account gets an automatic cash checking account at flatexDEGIRO Bank AG. While I understand the ease of having your brokerage account and bank under the same umbrella company, I dislike the automatic bank account.The brokerage account has the protection of the German Investor Compensation Scheme, which compensates investors up to 90% of their assets with a €20,000 maximum in case of default. Bank deposits at flatexDEGIRO Bank AG are guaranteed up to €100,000 by the German Deposit Guarantee Scheme.As an EU bank and broker, Degiro and flatexDEGIRO Bank AG operate under the strict rules of the ESMA protocol and European Central Bank. Therefore, I rate Degiro as a legitimate and safe broker.FeesI rank trading costs among the most defining aspects when evaluating a broker, as they directly impact profitability, especially when making lots of transactions. Degiro maintains low operating costs with a flat fee structure. A €1.00 handling fee applies to each transaction. US and Canadian equities cost €1.00. Most European equities cost €3.90, which increases to CHF5.00 for Swiss equities and €5.00 for Asian instruments. Despite the rise in fees, they remain ultra"

The maximum time for a client to receive data from a server is noted as 0.2 seconds from any part of the world.

It is authorized and regulated by the British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission (BVI FSC) under license number SIBA/L/14/1082. This regulator was established in 2001 and was under criticism by more established regulatory bodies for its approach to regulation. BVI FSC regulated brokers are not required to maintain a certain amount of capital in their bank accounts or to segregate client capital from corporate capital. BVI FSC brokers are equally not required to publish their execution policy or to participate in an investor compensation fund.The BVI FSC is making changes to its regulatory law as it matures, but it is worth noting that traders do not enjoy the equivalent level of protection as in other jurisdictions. It is possible to create a segregated portfolio company (SPC), but Instant Trading LTD does not fall into this category. Despite the modest regulatory environment, it does not mean InstaForex LTD has violated any rules or is actively doing so. This regulator does police its companies and ensures that they are financially sound and competent to carry on as a business. Likewise, it is important to note that BVI regulation does allow InstaForex LTD to offer higher leverage than other regulators, which could be a significant benefit for some traders.InstaForex LTD is a great example of a brokerage in a lesser regulated environment providing a sound service to its traders as evident by over 7,000,000 clients who manage their capital at this broker. Segregated accounts are available on request and only for deposits above $100,000. Key documents are universally available on their website and transparency is better than expected.EU traders are exclusively serviced by InstaForex EU LTD, licensed and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) under license number 266/15.Instant Trading LTD remains currently regulated by the BVI FSC.Segregated accounts are exclusively available on request and for deposits over $100,000; at another section, the minimum is stated as $50,000. This is unacceptable, and all traders should have access to the similar level of protection a segregated account offers.FeesInstaForex LTD is an ECN broker and derives its fees from a combination of spreads and commissions on over 300 assets offered. Spreads range between 0.0 pips and 7.0 pips in the Insta.Standard account types for major and minor currency pairs. The Insta.Eurica accounts offer a 0.0 spread for a commission in the range of 0.03% and 0.07% of the deal value. During this InstaForex LTD review it was unclear if the commission applies per lot traded or per sum of the deal ticket.CFDs on equities are exposed to corporate actions, like dividends and takeovers, and trading accounts are credited/debited the amount depending on the trading position. Commissions on equity CFDs are noted as 0.10% which represents the norm at many brokers. Commodity futures and CFDs introduce a commission of $30. Overnight financing charges or swap rates equally apply to all positions and traders can easily obtain the exact amounts from inside their MT4 trading platform.What Can I TradeInstaForex LTD offers over 300 assets across five classes, which is quite impressive. The primary focus remains the Forex market where asset selection is outstanding with 110 currency pairs available. Pure Forex traders have ample trading opportunities and many exotic currency pairs to choose from. Commodity selection is equally outstanding with a solid mix of hard and soft commodities, a total of 26 commodity futures contracts offer exposure across the entire spectrum.92 CFDs, mostly on shares, offer an acceptable introduction into the sector.

This broker is recognized for the vast sponsorships of professional sports in a statement to the general success of InstaForex. Plenty of auxiliary services are provided by this broker and the sum of this effort is a sound trading environment, but spreads remain elevated which represents the most significant drawback when considering InstaForex EU as an ideal broker.Regulation and SecurityInstant Trading EU LTD, the owner, and operator of InstaForex EU is licensed and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) under license number 266/15.

      "duct” as traders cannot purchase it; it is a platform which you can choose to use as a trading tool if you wish. Most Forex and CFD brokers offer the use of the MetaTrader 4 platform with their trading accounts, either as the only option, or as one of at least two trading platform options. MetaTrader 4 is without question the most widely used and persistently popular online trading platform in the world when it comes to trading Forex and CFDs. However, despite this strong popularity, the MetaQuotes Software have announced that they will not be granting any new licenses to brokers for MetaTrader 4, which means that new brokers will not be able to offer it as a platform for their customers. They have also stated that they are no longer offering any technical updates or support to or for the product’s software, although as at January 2018 it is still possible todownload a functional demo account. These developments show that MetaQuotes want brokers and traders to move away from MetaTrader 4 towards another product they offer,MetaTrader 5. Despite the same name and sequential number, MetaTrader 5 is by no means an upgraded 2.0 version of MetaTrader 4, so it is not clear how this situation will work out. Luckily, if you are working with an established Forex or CFD broker, you should be able to use MetaTrader 4 for some time longer, if you wish.Should I Use MetaTrader 4?If you are reading this review, you probably either want to learn more about the features of the MetaTrader 4 platform, or you need to decide whether to use this platform or another trading platform. As almost every Forex /CFD brokeroffers the use of MetaTrader 4 at the time of writing, it is a common decision which new traders face. Of course, it is impossible to say MetaTrader 4 is better or worse than other options, because it depends on what alternatives are available, and the alternative is often a proprietary trading platform unique to the Forex / CFD broker you are considering. Without knowing what your specific alternative is, no comparison or qualification can be offered.It is fair to say that new traders often worry too much about which trading platform to choose. This is partly because too many brokers make a big deal out of trading platforms to hide the fact that they offer poor spreads, overnight fees, and service to their customers. The more often you trade, the more important your trading platform becomes: if you are trading once per day or per week, fast execution and navigation becomes almost irrelevant. It is important to understand that a trading platform will not help you become a better or more profitable trader. The most vital considerations are whether a platform is easy to understand and use, and whether it works efficiently without bugs, glitches, or any kind of crashes, which can be costly and disappointing in trading. There is very little room for execution mistakes in trading. Most traders would probably agree that MetaTrader 4 passes these tests. Let’s advance to look at the pros and cons of using the MetaTrader 4 platform.Pros and Cons of MetaTrader 4Advantages (“Pros”)The platform is offered by mostForex / CFD brokers, so if you ever need to change your broker, you probably will not need to learn to use another trading platform if you do not want to.Similar in layout, design and function to the MetaTrader 5 platform, so if you later want to switch to this, the second most popular and widespread trading platform, it should be easy for you to learn how to use it.Very user",
