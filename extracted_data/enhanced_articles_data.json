    "description": "WTI Crude Oil and natural gas have substantially increased in price in the past year, which has helped fuel inflation globally.",
    "content": "Crushing WTI Crude Oil and Natural Gas CostsThe price of WTI Crude Oil as of this writing is nearly $80 and showing an ability to sustain this value over the short term. This price is substantially higher compared to the costs for a barrel of the commodity seen last year at about $37.00. Over the last week of trading WTI Crude Oil has shown strong price velocity as buyers have seemingly rushed into to make sure they have guaranteed supply and speculative elements have been active.The price of natural gas has also risen over the past year moving from $3.05 to approximately $5.52 today.The jump in natural gas has certainly been spurred on by increased demand, like its counterpart crude oil. However both commodities also have mounting costs due to rather questionable energy policy which has emerged from the US under the present White House Administration. It cannot be denied that WTI crude oil and natural gas have gained substantially in the past year.The effect of the rising prices in energy has a direct impact on inflation globally.Governments are combating the growing threat of inflation while also trying to boost their economies due to the ongoing saga of coronavirus and its toll on economies. Central banks have been looked to by governments to help create economic stimulus by keeping interest rates low. Higher prices for food and consumer goods can be linked fundamentally to the rising costs of energy which effects transportation and manufacturing costs.Higher Inflation and Lower Interest Rates: A Dangerous MixThe near-zero interest rate policy that is being practiced by many major central banks is now being confronted by mounting inflation, making monetary policy decisions regarding inflation difficult.The fact too that the US administration is talking about increased corporate taxes to help pay for its massive stimulus spending is and will continue to be passed on to consumers by companies which seek to keep their profit margins healthy.WTI Crude Oil Sustains Higher PricesNatural Gas Remains Near HighsCosmetic Interest Rate Policy and HikesThe Federal Reserve continues to threaten higher interest rate policies, but with actual rates near the 0.25% mark this is barely enough to have any real effect. It is still relatively cheap to borrow money.If the Federal Reserve were to increase its interest rate to 2% or 3% this may be commendable, but it is unlikely to happen because it would curtail the U.S economy and hurt the U.S stock market, andthe higher price of energy which is causing inflation is certainly not helping.The effect of more expensive money could in theory curtail inflation, but it would also hurt growth. However, even as governments pour cheap money into the system now, growth has been rather hard to attain.Without the massive amount of US stimulus there is data which shows that the growth rate would be recessionary and likely negative.The US government is allowing companies and citizens to function on cheap money to help fuel the economy and this is creating a cycle of debt which may prove hard to pay off in the future.Expensive Energy Equals Inflation and Lack of Growth: StagflationThe potential for inflation to continue running higher if energy costs mount is substantial.While supply chain is certainly a problem due to the impact of coronavirus on the workforce and its impact on production and logistics, the additional shadow of higher energy costs due to bad government policies is telling.WTI Crude Oil Past Month Price ChartBottom LineHigher energy costs are not going to go away soon unless there is a major drop in demand, and this is not going to happen without a global recession.Nobody wants this to happen. The specter of WTI Crude Oil at $100 might have seemed laughable last year, but it is now making some analysts legitimately worried.It seems likely that the price of WTI Crude Oil will remain high and continue to rise even higher over the near to medium-term, perhaps even as high as $100 per barrel.",

    "description": "Forex Market Today: Global markets tumble as stocks, crypto, and AUD plunge. Yen, Swiss Franc soar on safe-haven demand amid US-Iran tensions and economic woes.",
    "content": "The week has begun with a very strong selloff of risky assets such as stocks, crypto, and currencies such as the Australian Dollar, with money flowing into safe havens like the Japanese Yen and the Swiss Franc.Markets have been unusually turbulent since markets opened for the week just a few hours ago. The Japanese Yen, which has already increased in value by close to 10% within just the last couple of weeks, has already risen by 2% today against a basket of currencies. Other safe havens gained as a big selloff in stocks got underway, withthe Japanese Nikkei 225 Indexending the day lower by more than 10%. Markets in Japan and Korea were halted due to the outsized sudden losses. Such a swing towards risk-off sentiment may be explained by:US economic data released last Friday clearly showing the economy is stalling.Recent selloffs getting a psychological momentum of their own.A feeling the bull market had a great run, but its time must be up.Increasing concern that a full-scale war might erupt between Israel and the Iranian Axis. There are reports the US has warned the G7 nations that war could erupt as soon as tonight. However,Crude Oilis trading firmly lower, so the market does not seem too worried about Iranian oil assets.In the Forex market, the Japanese Yen has continued to make strong gains along with the Swiss Franc. The US Dollar can be a safe-haven currency but is not truly acting like one because of the Fed’s recent dovish tilt. The Japanese Yen has been the strongest major currency during this session, while the Australian Dollar has again been the weakest, puttingthe AUD/JPY currency crossin focus. Day traders will be interested in trading the high volatility in the Yen. There are Yen crosses that have moved by more than 10% in value in barely more than two weeks, which is extraordinary.Bitcoinhas fallen very sharply today, by more than 8% within only a few hours. Almost all risky assets are trading lower today, due to such strong sentiment since markets opened.Goldis firm, again approaching its recent record high price.There will be a release today in the USA of ISM Services PMI data, followed very early tomorrow by the Reserve Bank of Australia’s policy meeting at which it is expected to leave rates unchanged.Ready to trade ourdaily Forex analysis?

Many now realize that the early numbers were designed to get trading partners to the negotiating table, which has worked for most countries except for China.While prices have stagnated, behind the scenes, speculative capital is entering the market at a feverish pace, with onchain analytics firm Glassnode reporting a surge in Bitcoin’s so-called “hot capital.”#Bitcoin's Hot Capital (sum of coins moved in the last 24h + 1d–1w) reached $39.1B on 28 Apr - its highest since 10 Feb.

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) once again led the headlines in the crypto market this week after King Crypto rallied to a new all-time high near $112,000 amid geopolitical de-risking and rising turmoil in the Japanese bond market.Data provided by TradingView shows that after stabilizing near $106,000 last Tuesday, BTC bulls charged on Wednesday to rally above $110,000, then extended their run to the new record high of $112,000 on Thursday.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewMarket watchers attributed the rally to a variety of factors, including President Trump’s announcement of Russia–Ukraine ceasefire talks on May 19, the pause of high tariffs on EU trading partners in the US, and turmoil in bond markets.In the US, the 10-Year Treasury note hit nearly 4.63%, while the US30Y hit 5.153%, its highest level since October 2023. But the real story was in Japan, where the 30-year yield on Japanese bonds reached a new all-time high of 3.185% on May 20, 2025, before retreating to 3.115% on May 23.While government bonds are typically considered safe-haven assets, the recent sharp rise in yields suggests that investor concerns around fiscal sustainability and repayment risk are rising.“Because yields are increasing, sustainability becomes more of an issue, meaning credit risk increases, meaning yields increase even more,” said André Dragosch, Head of European Research at Bitwise. “And so you end up in this kind of fiscal debt doom loop.”He suggested that the increasing volatility in Japan’s bond market may be prompting some institutional investors to reconsider Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against sovereign default risk, noting that “This is now affecting other bond markets, especially the US Treasury market.”With bond market instability rising, highlighting sovereign credit risk concerns, Dragosch underscored Bitcoin’s increasing appeal as an “immutable asset” that is “free of counterparty risk” and serves as “a hedge against sovereign risk and sovereign default.”He added that if things continue on their current track, rising yields could help push Bitcoin towards $200,000, before noting that this remains conditional on continued Bitcoin accumulation by corporations and exchange-traded fund (ETF) holders.For now, that seems likely the case. As noted in last week’s crypto update, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan and noted Bitcoin basher, announced the bank will soon allow its clients to purchase Bitcoin ETFs.But in crypto, nothing is certain. According to analysts at Bitfinex, “The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoinʼs latest breakout was a local high or the prelude to a more aggressive leg higher in Q3.”As for the altcoin market, it was another relatively quiet week as all eyes were on Bitcoin, minus a few breakout tokens. Ether (ETH), for its part, reclaimed a key technical level – the mid-line (~$2,600) of the Gaussian Channel on the 2-week chart – which has historically preceded sharp price gains and marked the start of an “altseason” across multiple market cycles in the last five years.#AltcoinsIt has finally happened.??$ETHhas reclaimed the mid-line in the 2W Gaussian Channel.Each time it managed to do so, strong rallies followed for the entire altcoin market (2021 and 2024 as an example).Altseason isn't just a meme.. it's coming ladies & gentlemanpic.twitter.com/jQx1SCXvMo— ???????ⓗ? ? (@el_crypto_prof)May 27, 2025As noted by market analyst Moustache, this development has once again rekindled expectations that an altseason is fast approaching.At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $109,070, and Ether trades at $2,645.Stablecoins Go MainstreamWhile it was largely a week of consolidation for the crypto market, the asset class – particularly stablecoins – stepped into the TradFi limelight as Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, launched an initial public offering (IPO) of 24 million shares of its Class A common stock.Stablecoins have become a hot topic in the realm of payments, and Circle’s IPO launch suggests they will continue to play an expanding role. Thus, it's not surprising that the IPO launch coincided with the launch of the Circle Payments Network (CPN) Mainnet – a blockchain-powered payments coordination protocol that allows banks and payment providers to exchange payment instructions securely and settle in real time using USDC on public blockchains.Circle Payments Network Mainnet is officially live!Today marks a major milestone for Circle, for@USDC, and for the future of stablecoin powered payments.It started as an idea, but with our first transactions already happening on CPN, it has become a reality.Cross border…pic.twitter.com/hC4ihmIPnN— Circle (@circle)May 21, 2025While the announcement may seem innocuous to some, the stakes are high in the payments space, and the competition is heating up.

    "content": "The decision was widely expected, and the US Dollar has shown a bullish but muted response.Fed Warns Tariffs Could Cause StagflationThe Fed statement noted that although the US economy was performing well, “uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further”. The Committee was of the opinion that “the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen”. This was a clear warning from the Fed that US tariffs have raised the risk of stagflation, a combination of higher unemployment and higher inflation in an environment of lower growth.Powell’s Pushback against TrumpAhead of the rate decision, there was little doubt that the Fed would decide to hold rates, but there was a buzz in the markets as to whether Fed Chair Powell would push back against President Trump, who has been lobbying loudly for the Fed to cut rates. Powell didn’t disappoint in his press conference, stating that Trump’s tariffs had hurt consumer and business sentiment and reiterating the rate statement warning that if the tariffs stayed in place, they would likely cause stagflation. Since the tariff policy was not yet set, the effects on the economy remain “highly uncertain” and the Fed could not be preemptive until it had further data.Powell added that the Fed “was in a good position to “wait and see”, perhaps a subtle jab at Trump that the Fed was in no rush to lower rates. The markets have responded to Powell’s warning about tariffs and his ‘wait-and-see” stance by lowering the likelihood of a cut in June to 20%, down from 31% just prior to Wednesday’s decision, according to CME’s FedWatch.US Dollar Shrugs, Stock Market Slightly HigherThe Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain rates did not move the US Dollar by much, while the US stock market responded with slight gains on Wednesday.On Thursday, the US Dollar is showing limited movement. TheEUR/USDandGBP/USDare largely unchanged.

Average Hourly Earnings growth was also lower than expected, at 0.2% month-on-month.

It is widely expected that the annualized rate will remain unchanged at 2.4%, with month-on-month CPI expected to show an increase of 0.3%. If the data is higher than expected, that could boost the USD and sink US stocks; if lower than expected, the opposite will be likely.The big news yesterday was the announcement of a trade deal between the USA and China, who have been engaged in a noisy and destructive trade war since Trump took office in January. It was agreed that during an upcoming 90-day period for further negotiations, the US would drop tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China would drop tariffs on US imports from 125% to 10%. The US Dollar and US stock markets immediately jumped and held these increases, withthe NASDAQ 100 Indexup by 4.4% on the day andthe S&P 500 Indexclosing higher by 3.3%. Asian stock markets have mostly continued this rally, although Chinese indices are trading lower today. This news is likely to be bullish for global risk-on sentiment generally, including stock markets.Following yesterday's trade deal between the USA and China, markets are now expecting only 2 US rate cuts over the course of 2025, at 0.25% each, according tothe CME FedWatch tool. The first cut is not expected until September.In the Forex market, since today's Tokyo open, the Australian Dollar has been the strongest major currency, while the USD has been the weakest, puttingthe AUD/USD currency pairin focus - the Aussie typically gains when global risk sentiment improves.

The annualized rate was expected to remain unchanged from last month at 2.4%, but it ticked a fraction lower to 2.3%. Both Core CPI and regular CPI were expected to show a month-on-month increase of 0.3% but the actual rates were 0.2%. This gave a boost to risk sentiment and was expressed in the US stock market, helped by President Trump's announcement on a visit to Saudi Arabia of a huge deal where Saudi Arabia will purchase $142 billion worth of military equipment from US manufacturers and invest billions more (possibly as much as $600 billion) in the US economy. This pushed US equities to extend yesterday's gains significantly, with boththe NASDAQ 100 Indexandthe S&P 500 Indexrising firmly - each index is now trading well above its 200-day moving average, after strong and significant recoveries from the \"Trump tariff lows\" of a few weeks ago.

This suggests Australian inflationary pressures are still slightly on the hot side, and that may have helped boost the Aussie during the Asian session, withthe AUD/USD currency pairslightly higher.German and Japanese inflation released yesterday came in exactly as expected.The Forex market had a relatively quiet Asian session, with little price movement. Yesterday saw many currencies make gains against the US Dollar.There will be a release much later of Australian Unemployment rate data.",

Markets will probably take direction from the PPI and Retail Sales data.The stock market euphoria earlier in the week over the news that the US and China had reached a \"truce deal\" reducing tariffs temporarily in their trade war has gone, despite President Trump announcing some large deals with Saudi Arabia and Qatar during his visits there this week, which he claimed will be worth over $1 trillion to the US economy, although the exact amount is disputed by many analysts.UK GDP data released earlier today was unexpectedly positive, showing GDP had increased by 0.2% month-on-month when no change was expected.

As markets opened this week, the downgrade was reflected in lower off-hours prices in trading in all the major US equity indices, although the declines are not especially large. The US Dollar is also lower, but again, not by very much. As these price movements are small, and as other ratings agencies have already made this same downgrade, it seems very certain to be the kind of event that markets will shrug off as soon as there is another item of important news, so bulls shouldn't get pessimistic over this except over the short-term.In the Forex market the strongest major currency since the Tokyo open has been the Euro, while the Canadian Dollar has been the weakest. Markets are likely to remain in a mildly risk-off mode today following the US credit downgrade.Bitcoin a few hours ago traded near $107,5000 making a new near 4-month high but then fell strongly from there. The daily candlestick for today now looks like it will become a bearish outside bar engulfing the past three days of price action.

The statement said that the New Zealand economy was improving but tariffs and global economic uncertainty would likely dampen the recovery and reduce inflationary pressures.The members highlighted the downward revision to economic growth forecasts for China and the US due to the tariffs between the two countries, which are expected to lower global demand for New Zealand exports.The rate decision was widely expected but the 5-1 vote (one member voted to maintain rates) was a surprise as the decision was expected to be unanimous.RBNZ Governor Hawkesby: Next Rate Decision Will Depend on “Developments”RBNZ Governor Christian Hawkesby said at a follow-up press conference that the central bank would make its next rate decision based on “developments”, in particular what those developments mean for medium term inflation pressure. Hawkesby said that the RBNZ current forecasts did not indicate a bias either way as to what would be the central bank’s next step. The Bank’s chief economist, Paul Conway, supported Hawkesby’s remarks by stating that the cash rate was now within the neutral zone.This is a significant point as it means that the RBNZ is comfortable with current rates and can ease off its aggressive cutting unless the data and geopolitical concerns dictate a change in rates. The RBNZ doesn’t meet again until July 9.New Zealand Dollar Higher, Stock Market Declines Sharply after RBNZ AnnouncementThe New Zealand dollar has gained ground despite today’s rate cut. The NZD/USD currency pair gained ground immediately after the rate announcement and has held onto these gains in the European session. NZD/USD is currently trading at 0.5969, up 0.37% on the day.The NZX 50, New Zealand’s main stock index, posted sharp losses today. The index fell 220 points (1.75%), and closed at 12,362.Ready to tradeourForex daily analysis and predictions? Check out thebest forex brokers in New Zealandworth using",

    "description": "US inflation dips to 2.3%, lowest since 2021; CPI miss sends USD lower, boosts stocks; Fed likely to hold rates as tariff effects loom.",
    "content": "The US consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.3% year-on year in April, down from 2.4% in March and below the market estimate of 2.4%. This was the lowest annual inflation rate since February 2021. Gasoline prices dropped sharply and a steep decline in egg prices sent grocery prices lower. Monthly, CPI rose to 0.2% from -0.1%, below the market estimate of 0.3%.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, remained unchanged at 2.8% year-on-year. Monthly, the core rate gained 0.2%, up from 0.1% and below the market estimate of 0.3%.This inflation report was particularly significant as some of President Trump’s tariffs took effect in April. The tariffs are expected to dampen growth and raise inflation, and the lower-than expected CPI was a relief to the financial markets, sending equities higher and the US dollar lower.The tariffs could take several months to impact the US economy, which means we could see higher inflation data in June or July, fueled by the tariffs.Fed Expected to Stay on Sidelines at Next MeetingThe Federal Reserve maintained rates at 4.25-4.5% at last week’s meeting and Fed Chair Powell signaled that rate policy was in a good place and there was no rush to lower rates. Powell pushed back against President Trump’s loud calls for the Fed to lower interest rates. With the April report indicating that inflation was lower than expected, Powell can afford to continue his wait-and-see stance until Trump’s erratic tariff policy becomes clearer. The markets have priced in another rate hold at the June meeting at above 90%.US Dollar Loses Ground, Stock Market Climbs after Inflation ReportThe US dollar posted strong losses against the major currencies on Tuesday in the aftermath of today’s lower-than-expected inflation report as risk appetite has increased.AUD/USD, a risk currency, surged 1.55% on Tuesday and is up another 0.4% on Wednesday. TheGBP/USD currency pairclimbed 0.98% on Tuesday and has added gains of 0.36% on Wednesday.The US stock market posted gains on Tuesday, as investors reacted positively to the inflation report.The S&P 500 Index climbed 42.36 points (0.72%) and closed at 5,886.55.

Iran has instead proposed it will limit enrichment on its own soil to 3.67% if Israel dismantles its own alleged nuclear weapons program. It also seems the Iranian regime has stolen IAEA documents purporting to its inspections of an Israeli nuclear facility which it may use to embarrass Israel and western nations. The Iranians are claiming that the documentation will allow it precisely target all of Israel's alleged secret nuclear facilities in the event of an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. More sophisticated traders might want to look into the possibility of buying highly out of the money options on crude oil as in the event of a full-scale war with Iran, crude oil prices are bound to rise dramatically,In the Forex market, one of the most notable developments has been the decline in the US Dollar since the market opened a few years ago. The price is now approaching the multi-year supportive floor at 97.67. If we see a breakdown below that level, this could trigger a much stronger fall in the greenback. Currency pairs to watch in this case are theGBP/USDand to a lesser extentEUR/USD. Since today's Tokyo open, the Forex market has been quiet, which makes sense as markets will be awaiting tomorrow's release of US CPI (inflation) data.There are no data releases of high importance scheduled today, so it might be a quiet day in the markets.",

However, the war between Iran and Israel has entered its fourth day with continuing escalation. Israel has continued striking regime, military, and even infrastructure targets throughout Iran more or less around the clock. Iran last night and early this morning fired missiles at strategic targets in the Israeli city of Haifa, while later targeting civilian residences with precision ballistic missiles, killing several civilians and wounding scores. Israel's defense minister will shortly announce evacuation orders for neighborhoods in the Iranian capital before systematically destroying buildings.There are increasing signs that the USA is positioning itself to join offensive operations on the side of Israel. It may well be that President Trump is hoping that if Iran does not sue for peace, Israel may be able to do enough damage that US air power could complete the destruction of Iran's nuclear program without much blowback to US bases and allies in the region. President Trump has hinted that the US could become involved.Since the Iran/Israel conflict began, the price of crude oil has risen by almost 10%, and in eastern markets it has spiked higher again as the day begins, reaching very close to new 4-month high prices.

    "content": "Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewAs the extent of Iran's military disarray becomes apparent and the regime asks for talks, President Trump prepares to join the war or force a major Iranian concession in a deal.Markets remain relatively quiet, with participants watching the ongoing war between Iran and Israel which has now entered its fifth day. Yesterday saw Israel score major tactical successes through air power which seem to have led to a 90% reduction in Iranian missile fire. The Iranian regime made major threats to inflict massive damage on Tel Aviv but was able to fire fewer than 10 ballistic missiles during the hours of darkness, doing very little damage, although a further barrage this morning of 20 missiles resulted in at least two direct hits in the Tel Aviv region. It seems likely that Israel has been able to significantly suppress the missile fire by the use of air power, although a daylight barrage of 20 missiles achieved at least two direct hits, at least one was clearly targeting a civilian apartment block, similar to earlier strikes.President Trump caused a sensation in the early hours of the morning in the Middle East as he departed early from the G7 to return to the situation room at the White House, as the US seems poised to either join the assault on Iran's nuclear program. Trump angrily tweeted that Iran cannot be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, mocked Tucker Carlson, one of the major critics of US involvement in the war against Iran's nuke program and mocked French President Macron for suggesting a ceasefire. Trump has since said he wants a \"real end\" to Iran's nuclear enrichment, denying he wants a ceasefire.Only the US military can destroy the crucial Iranian nuclear installation at Fordow with a B2 aircraft and a special bunker buster that can penetrate and destroy up to half a mile underground. It seems as if Israel has more or less destroyed the Natanz facility and damaged several others already.Markets seem to be acknowledging that Israel is likely moving towards a victory, as the price ofWTI Crude Oilstabilizes and safe haven assets drop a little. However Trump's moves over the last hours have seen major US stock market indices lower a little, as this could trigger Iranian attacks on US bases in the region, and possibly lead to disruption of crude oil flow in the Gulf.Silver is rising to get within sight of its long-term high price.

The Iranian regime again made major threats to inflict massive damage on Tel Aviv but was unable to fire more than 40 ballistic missiles during the hours of darkness, doing little damage, with no fatalities. It seems quite certain that Israel has been able to significantly suppress the missile fire by the use of air power. However, it has been revealed that Iran was able two days ago to put Israel's oil refinery in Haifa out of action.President Trump continues to take a hard line on Iran, saying he wants the regime's complete surrender and that Iran cannot be allowed a nuclear weapon, and signaling a total lack of support for a ceasefire. In the past few hours, Israel destroyed the Fordow plant's air defense system. President Trump is considering joining battle, and there are reports he has sent two B2 stealth bombers to the region, which would be used to destroy Fordow with bunker busters. Fordow is the key to Iran's nuclear weaponisation program.The USA is positioning for something major before the weekend begins, according to open signal intelligence.Markets seem to be a bit more nervous today, as the price ofWTI Crude Oilremains near its 4-month high.

    "content": "Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewThe Fed's refusal to quicken the pace of rate cuts and the growing likelihood of regional war in the Middle East are weighing on global risk sentiment.The US Federal Reserve met last night, announcing that it will maintain its interest rate at the relatively high rate of 4.25%, as was almost unanimously expected by analysts. The most important part of the release and press conference was the emphasis that the Fed is in no hurry to cut its interest rate, despite the risk to the economy which will potentially be caused by President Trump's new tariffs and resulting retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries. This saw stocks and other risky assets taking a downturn, with the US Dollar and other safe haven assets benefiting.According tothe CME FedWatch tool, markets are still expecting two rate cuts by the Fed before the end of 2025, one in September and one in December, so this is really only a minor development.The war between Iran and Israel enters its seventh day with Israel striking hard at the Iranian nuclear program, including Isfahan and Arak, and continuing to hit regime targets. Yesterday saw President Trump forcefully reject talk of a ceasefire at the same time as three Iranian government planes were allowed by Israel to depart Iran and arrive in Oman. President Trump stated that he demanded nothing less than unconditional surrender by Iran, after which the Iranian nuclear program would be peacefully destroyed. Trump's bottom line: Iran must not develop a nuclear weapon. Stock markets rose as rumours of an Iranian desire to visit Trump circulated, but Iranian Supreme Leader angrily rejected any talk of \"groveling before the White House\". Minutes later, the US began organising to evacuate more of its citizens and assets from the region, signaling a potential escalation. On the USA getting involved in attacking Iran, Trump said \"I might do it, I might not\". Most analysts see the chance of US involvement as rising, with Israeli government officials apparently convinced it is a question of when, not if.The rate of successful Iranian missile fire on Israel had so declined that yesterday the Israeli governent ordered a reopening of workplaces provided they are located near protected areas. About an hour after dawn, Iran fired a relatively large missile barrage targeting a major hospital in Beersheva, a financial target in Ramat Gan, and a residential area near Tel Aviv. There are at least 100 wounded, several seriously. The Israeli government has responded by stating that it will increase its efforts to hit regime targets in Iran, and labelling Khamenei as a war criminal. This is somewhat of an escalation and might further weigh on risk sentiment, as President Trump has been protecting Khameini from being targeted. The price ofWTI Crude Oilis rising, looking bullish near its 4-month high.The Bank of England will be holding a policy meeting today but is not expected to cut its interest rate.The Swiss National Bank will be holding a policy meeting today and is expected to cut its interest rate from 0.25% to 0%.The Forex market is more active this morning.

So far, nothing has occurred, and while markets arguably remain nervous, risk assets have in fact risen a little since markets opened a few hours ago.Israel has continued its bombing campaign, widening its strikes to include strategic military assets, as well as surface to surface missiles on the ground. Over the past 24 hours, Iran has succeeded in sending only a single missile into Israel, which was intercepted. Despite Iranian propaganda to the contrary, is lack of bite against Israel now is striking.Although the Iranian Parliament has voted to close the Strait of Hormuz, which would send crude oil prices soaring and deliver a strong economic shock to the global economy, no action to this effect has yet materialized. US Secretary Rubio has reached out to China, which would suffer greatly if Iran took such action, It is worth noting that Iran's oil exports, upon which it relies hugely for revenue, would also be blocked if the Strait were closed.The price ofWTI Crude Oilremains relatively high, but has sold off during the Asian session, indicating a market assessment that a closure of the Strait currently looks unlikely.The price ofGold, a key safe haven, has also declined over the Asian session, reinforcing my point above.The Forex market is more active this morning.

There are no details on any agreed terms beyond \"peace-for-peace\". This came mere hours after a purely symbolic Iranian \"response\" targeting the US military base in Qatar. Shortly after 9am IST Israel confirmed it would accept the ceasefire, and with Iran already stating they would cease fire if Israel did, we might be seeing the end of this war, or at least this battle.The Trump administration has, interestingly, bothered to give the Israel / Iran war a name - the \"12 Day War\". There are two reasons for this choice of name:Echo the 6 Day War (a major Israeli military victory in 1967)To make sure everyone understands that the war ends today.All parties have good reasons to keep the ceasefire, so it is likely to hold.Markets began reacting with increased risk-on sentiment as soon as the laughable nature of the Iranian response became obvious, which then increased after President Trump's announcement of the ceasefire a few hours later, withWTI Crude Oilquickly falling strongly to trade below $71.

    "content": "Data from CoinGecko shows that the total market capitalization of memecoins has climbed in the last 24 hours, rising 2% to $66.6 billion. In comparison, the global crypto market capitalization has increased by a mere 0.8% over the same timeframe to rest at $3.31 trillion.Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has remained flat, hovering around $105,000, after dropping by 0.5% on the day.

Ethereum-based Pepe (PEPE) followed with 7.6% gains to trade at $0.00001260, and Bonk (BONK) came in third after rising 5.2% over the same period.Performance of Top-Cap Memecoins. Source: CoinGeckoDOGE – the leading meme token by market capitalization – saw a 1.75% price ascent on the day, bringing its market cap to $29.2 billion. Notably, DOGE still accounts for nearly 44% of the memecoin sector’s total market share.Its rival, SHIB, also recovered on June 2, up 2.8% on the day, increasing its market cap to $7.7 billion, cementing its position as the second most popular memecoin.Let’s look at some of the reasons why memecoins are up today.Strong Altcoin Market StructureFrom a historical perspective, the bull market is usually driven by a rally in altcoins. As such, in line with the current recovery of memecoin prices, TOTAL3 - the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH)- has experienced a significant rise after its rally that began in mid-April.The chart below shows that TOTAL3 has increased by 30% since the second week of April to $858.1 billion. This rise has led to the appearance of an ascending parallel channel on the weekly chart, as shown below.Traders bought the dips as the relative strength index (RSI) on the weekly chart fell below the mid-line to 42 in early April at the height of Trump’s tariff-driven sell-off.The RSI’s reading is currently in the positive region at 52, suggesting that trader interest in altcoins is increasing as the momentum picks up.Total Crypto Market Cap Excluding BTC and ETH. Source: TradingViewAltcoins are still pursuing an extended uptrend, confirmed by TOTAL3’s continued upward movement inside an ascending parallel channel.If TOTAL3 manages to overcome the strong resistance between $900 billion and $935 billion, it will rise to the upper boundary of the ascending channel at $1.02 trillion. If this happens, altcoins, including major memecoins, could continue rallying over the next few weeks.On the other hand, a drop below the lower boundary of the channel at $842 billion will see the price drop toward the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) currently sitting at $775 billion. Losing this support will trigger massive sell orders that could see TOTAL3 drop toward the $700 billion psychological level.Memecoins See an Increase in OI and Trading VolumeThe rally in memecoins on June 3 was preceded by an increase in open interest (OI), with WIF leading the charge with a 13% increase in OI over the last 24 hours. POPCAT saw its IO jump by nearly 12% on the day to $157 million, more than $10 million higher than MOODENG’s $146 million in OI, which had increased by 11.9% over the same period. DOGE’s OI was standing at $2.1 billion, up approximately 1.3% over the last 24 hours.Memecoin OI Chart. Source: CoinGlassOpen Interest refers to the total amount of pending derivative contracts that have not yet been settled. In a futures contract, for every seller, a buyer is required to settle the contract.The chart above also revealed a notable increase in the daily trading volume of memecoins in the derivatives market, with MOODENG leading the jump by 102%. Overall, the daily trading volume of memecoins has risen 27% in the past 24 hours to $26 billion.The rise in OI and trading volume for memecoins indicates bullish momentum in the market as leverage traders open more contracts in anticipation of price increases.Ready to trade ourdaily Forex analysis on Bitcoin?Here’s our list of thebest MT4 crypto brokersworth reviewing.",

    "content": "The United States Federal Reserve maintained the benchmark rate at a range between 4.25% and 4.5% at Wednesday’s meeting. This comes after the Fed held rates at this level at its prior meetings in January, March and May, after cutting rates at the final three meetings in 2024. Today’s decision, which was a unanimous vote, was widely expected. The US dollar has showed little response to the Fed decision.FOMC Statement Dovish, Notes Concern about Inflation, US EconomyThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement noted that, “the unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated”. The statement added that concern about the economic outlook “has diminished but remains elevated”.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the message of the FOMC statement at his press conference, saying that “despite elevated uncertainty, the economy is in a solid position. Powell said that the labor market was in good shape and inflation had dropped significantly but was still above the 2% target.Powell: Tariffs Starting to Affect InflationPowell also discussed the US tariffs, saying that although recent inflation readings had been “favorable”, the Fed was “beginning to see some effects” of tariffs on inflation and that he expected upcoming inflation reports to reflect higher inflation as the tariffs continued to filter through the economy.US President Trump has been highly critical of Powell for not lowering interest rates but Powell has stuck to his guns. Powell again defended his position on Wednesday, saying that the Fed’s current stance leaves it “well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.”The Fed also released its “dot plot”, a chart of where each FOMC member thinks interest rates are headed. The dot plot showed members expect two interest rates in 2025 and one more cut in 2026 and 2027.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewUS Dollar, Stock Markets Shrug after Fed AnnouncementThe US dollar showed little reaction to the Fed decision. USD/JPY, EUR/USD and GBP/USD are showing limited movement on Thursday. The exception has been AUD/USD, which is down 0.49%, and NZD/USD , which has declined 0.75%. These declines are likely due to a soft Australian employment report on Thursday. US stock markets showed virtually no reaction in the aftermath of the Fed decision.

Similarly, the core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy and is closely watched by the Fed, rose 3.7% in Q1, up from 3.6% in the second estimate.Thursday’s weak GDP report is a clear indication that the US economy is slowing down, but the labour market remains surprisingly resilient. Initial jobless claims, released today, dropped to 236,000, down from an upwardly revised 246,000 in the previous release and below the consensus of 245,000. If the US labor market continues to post strong numbers, market expectations for a rate cut in the next few months will increase.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewUS Dollar Loses Ground, Stock Markets Slightly HigherIn the Forex market, the US dollar has retreated against all the major currencies in the aftermath of the GDP and unemployment claims report.

    "description": "US inflation rose to 2.4% in May, below forecasts. Core CPI steady at 2.8%. Tariffs had limited impact. USD dipped; stocks were little changed.",
    "content": "Markets were treated to a positive May inflation report, as inflation was lower than expected despite fears that US tariffs would boost inflation.US CPI Inches Higher to 2.4% Year-On-YearThe US consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.4% year-on year in May, up from 2.3% in April. The CPI reading marked the first acceleration in four months but importantly, was below the market estimate of 2.5%. Energy costs were down sharply while food and shelter prices were higher. Monthly, CPI rose 0.1%, down from 0.2% in April and below the market estimate of 0.2%.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, remained unchanged at 2.8% year-on-year for a third straight month and holding at its lowest level since 2021. Monthly, the core rate rose just 0.1%, up from 0.2% and below the market estimate of 0.2%.Perhaps the biggest surprise from the inflation report was that President Trump’s tariffs, many of which took effect in April, did not have a more significant impact on inflation. There had been fears that the tariffs would significantly raise prices on US imports and would cause a price shock, but fortunately those fears proved groundless. While today’s inflation report is reassuring, it’s too early to celebrate as it could be several more months before the tariffs make their way into the CPI data.US inflation will be sensitive to developments in the global trade arena. President Trump has announced that the US and China have reached a trade deal which includes tariffs of 55% on Chinese products. If the deal is finalized, these tariffs will make Chinese products more expensive for US consumers and will likely be reflected in US inflation data in the coming months.US Dollar Lower, Stock Market Quiet Inflation ReportThe US dollar has lost ground against the British pound and the Euro on Wednesday in the aftermath of today’s lower-than-expected inflation report. TheEUR/USD currency pairis trading at 1.1458, up 0.34%. TheGBP/USD currency pairrose as much as 0.57% earlier but has since given up most of those gains.The US stock market has only been open for a short time and investors have been slow to react to today’s lower-than-expected inflation report.TheS&P 500 Indexis almost unchanged, up 2.3 points (0.062%) and is currently trading at 6,043.TheNasdaq 100 Indexhas posted small gains of 34.3 points (0.15%) and is currently trading at 22,061.Ready to tradeourForex daily analysis and predictions?

    "content": "Today’s decision keeps the ECB deposit rate at 2.0%, its lowest level since October 2022. The ECB has been aggressive in the current easing cycle, trimming rates by a quarter-point over the last seven consecutive meetings. Just over a year ago, the deposit rate stood at 4.5%.The ECB stayed on the sidelines primarily due lingering uncertainty over US President Trump’s erratic trade policy. The US has yet to reach a trade agreement with the European Union and Trump has threatened to impose a 30% tariff on European imports if a deal isn’t reached by August 1. The EU has made plans for retaliatory tariffs in case there’s no deal, which could trigger further US tariffs and set off a bruising trade war between two of the world’s largest economies. With eurozone inflation hovering close to the ECB’s target of 2%, the central bank is under less pressure to continue cutting rates and will be waiting to see if the US and the EU can reach a deal. If the sides hammer out an agreement, the ECB could resume lowering rates as soon as September.The ECB rate statement said that inflation was moving “in line” with the Bank’s inflation outlook and that it would not provide guidance with regard to monetary policy, as rate decisions would be made based on economic data. The ECB noted that domestic inflation continues to fall but the economic environment remains “exceptionally uncertain”.The money markets have priced in at least one more rate cut before the end of the year, and if inflation continues to ease, we could see further cuts as the ECB would like to boost the eurozone economy by providing rate relief.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewEuro Edges Higher, European Stock Markets Mixed After ECB DecisionIn the aftermath of the ECB rate decision, theEUR/USD currency pairis up by 0.28% today, trading at 1.1776 at the time of writing.

The bullishness is especially notable in the US tech sector, withthe NASDAQ 100 Indextrading above and theS&P 500trading higher yesterday to make new record highs. The S&P 500 Index just had its best quarter since 2023, increasing in value by more than 10% since April began. Trend and momentum traders will be interested in being long of these indices, and have a choice of CFDs, futures, or ETFs such as SPY and QQQ.The US Dollar Index has continued to fall, reaching a new 3.5-year low on declining rate expectations, as President Trump has publicly fumed about getting a new Fed Chair in place, stating over the weekend that rates should be 1% or 2%, not the 4.25% which they currently stand at. This has increased expectations of rate cuts over 2025 from 2 cuts of 0.25% to 3 cuts one at each remaining Fed meeting.The Forex market is showing increased price movement and volatility, with the declining US Dollar one of the main market drivers right now. Since the Tokyo open, the strongest major currency has been the Japanese Yen, while the weakest has been the Australian Dollar, puttingthe AUD/JPY currency crossin focus.The EUR/USD currency pairhas continued to advance, reaching a new 3.5 year high above $1.1800 earlier, so trend traders will want to be long here - this currency pair has a great record of respecting its long-term trends. The Euro stands out for its long-term strength, especially as it just reached its highest level since 2014 against the Chinese Yuan.

A more immediate impact is a strengthening of a Japanese Yen which has been trending weaker for some time now, triggering what might be major trend reversals. However, it needs to be remembered that it is not clear that a change of government or majority in the upper house is necessarily going to lead to a stronger Yen over the longer-term, for now we just know it is a likely short-term effect.New Zealand CPI (inflation) data released earlier came in a fraction higher than expected, showing a month-on-month increase of 0.6% when an increase of only 0.5% was widely forecasted. This seems to have had little effect upon the Kiwi but might have sent it marginally lower.Major US stock market indices gave up some of their gains late last Friday, but in off-hours trading today are advancing close to new record highs.The NASDAQ 100 Indexandthe S&P 500 Indexare both looking bullish right now and seem likely to make new records. If we get a strongly bullish close today, as it is a Monday, that will be a very bullish sign.Precious metals are looking bullish so far today, with Silver advancing especially firmly near to its 13-year high which it made recently. Copper is also advancing firmly towards its recent high price.In the Forex market, the Japanese Yen has been the strongest major currency this week, while the New Zealand Dollar is the weakest.The EUR/USD currency pairremains within a valid long-term bullish trend but is far from its near-term high price.The digital assetBitcoinis rising firmly towards key resistance at $120,000. Trend traders will have been long for about two weeks and will probably still be seeing their trades in floating profit. For those finding it difficult to access Bitcoin, there are several affordable Bitcoin ETFs as well as Bitcoin micro futures (10% of a Bitcoin).It is a public holiday today in Japan.",

US tariffs on Japanese auto imports will be set at a relatively low rate of 15%. According to President Trump, Japan has committed to invest $550 billion in the USA as part of the deal. Japanese PM Ishida, already badly wounded by his government's loss of control of the upper house of the Japanese Parliament last weekend, has committed to resign, but wants to finalise all the details of the trade deal first.

This seems to be mostly due to optimism that the US will now strike more reasonable trade deals with other nations and trading blocs (for example the EU) after agreeing to impose a relatively low 15% tariff on Japanese auto imports earlier this week.

The centrepiece of the deal is a 15% tariff on EU imports into the USA, far lower than the 50% President Trump once threatened, although it is higher than the pre-Trump average tariff of 2%. The news sent futures trading in the broad S&P 500 Indexandthe NASDAQ 100 Indexrising strongly to new record high prices. Although stock markets globally are generally bullish, EU and Asian stock indices are not performing nearly as well as major US indices.

    "content": "Today’s rate announcement was significant as it marks the first time that the central bank has failed to lower rates since it started the current easing cycle in August 2024. The RBNZ had lowered rates at six consecutive meetings, chopping 225 basis points during that period. The benchmark rate has remained at its lowest level since August 2022.RBNZ statement: Uncertainty Requires CautionWhy the change in rate policy? The rate statement noted that the “economic outlook remains highly uncertain” and said that the rate path would depend on the following factors – the speed of the economic recovery, inflation and the impact of tariffs.At the same time, the RBNZ signaled that it would continue to loosen monetary policy if inflation continued to ease as the Bank has projected. The Bank released an updated inflation forecast which projected inflation moving towards the top of the Bank’s 1-3% target band in mid-2025 and easing to around 2% by early 2026 due to lower underlying inflation and spare capacity in the economy.The bottom line of the RBNZ rate decision? Today’s hold is likely a short breather rather than a change in monetary policy. The RBNZ signaled at the meeting that it plans to continue trimming rates in order to kick-start the struggling economy, assuming that the economy, and particularly inflation, evolves in line with the RBNZ’s forecasts.The New Zealand economy tipped into a recession last year and lower global demand has hurt the export-dependent economy. The markets expect at least one more rate cut before the end of the year but the rate path will largely depend on inflation and growth data.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewNew Zealand Dollar Steady, Stock Market Dips SharplyThe New Zealand dollar has shown a muted response to today’s rate decision.The NZD/USD currency pairis currently trading at 0.5993, down 0.07% on the day.

    "description": "The Fed holds interest rates steady, with two dissenters pushing for cuts; Powell offers no clarity on September, citing tariff and inflation uncertainty.",
    "content": "The decision was widely expected and the US dollar has posted losses on Thursday against most of the major currencies after gaining strongly Wednesday to reach a new 2-month high.Two FOMC Members Dissent with DecisionThe decision to hold interest rates was not a surprise but there was some drama as two Fed governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman voted to lower rates. This marked the first time since 1993 (259 consecutive meetings) that more than one member has dissented with a rate decision.The split vote reflects division within the Fed, which could prove a problem for Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Waller and Bowman have both expressed concerns about the deteriorating US labor market and favored a rate cut at the meeting.The rate statement had a somewhat hawkish tone, with members noting that labor market conditions “remain solid” and inflation remains “somewhat elevated”. The Fed has little reason to lower rates if the labor market is strong and inflation is still high and there is still significant uncertainty surrounding US trade policy.Powell: Effect of Tariffs Still UncertainIn his follow-up press conference, Powell said there were early signs that tariffs had resulted in higher inflation but “their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen” and that the tariffs could cause “more persistent” inflationary pressures. Powell didn’t give much applause to the recent trade deals signed with Japan and the European Union, saying only that it was a “dynamic” time for trade negotiations.For investors, Powell’s press conference was significant in what he didn’t state. There were expectations that the Fed might signal that a September cut was on the table, but Powell poured cold water on these hopes, saying that “we have made no decisions about September” and adding that the decision would be based on the data available to the Fed.US Dollar Lower, Stock Markets Steady After Rate DecisionThe Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain rates has given the US dollar a boost on Thursday, while the US stock market showed little reaction on Wednesday.The US Dollar has retreated against the majors on Thursday.

    "content": "The markets were braced for a rebound in June inflation in Canada and the US and that’s exactly what happened today in both countries, as CPI and core CPI climbed higher.US CPI, Core CPI Hotter in JuneThe US consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-on year in June, up from 2.4% in May, matching the consensus expectation. This was the second consecutive monthly rise in inflation, which is now at its highest level since February 2025. On a month-on-month basis, CPI rose to 0.3% from 0.1% in May, the largest increase in five months and matching the consensus.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, climbed to 2.9% from 2.8% but below the consensus of 3.0%. Monthly, the core rate rose 0.3%, up from 0.1% in May and matched the consensus.The hotter June inflation numbers were most likely driven by President Trump’s tariffs, which have raised the price on most products imported into the US. The tariffs, which were first imposed in April, did not show a spike in inflation until now and we can expect upcoming that the tariffs will also be felt in upcoming inflation reports as the tariffs continue to filter through the US economy.Today’s hot inflation report means pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower rates will ease. The money markets have priced a hold at the July 30 meeting at close to 100%, although the Fed is expected to resume cutting rates in the fourth quarter.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewCanada’s CPI Hits 1.9%Canada’s inflation rate also heated up in June. CPI rose to 1.9% year-on-year, up from 1.7% in May and in line with the consensus. Inflation remained below the Bank of Canada’s target rate of 2% for a third successive month. Monthly, CPI dropped to 0.1%, compared to 0.6% in May and matching the consensus expectation. The trimmed-mean core CPI, which the BoC uses as its preferred gauge for underlying inflation, was unchanged at 3% y/y, as expected. BoC policymakers won’t be losing any sleep over headline CPI, which remains below the 2% target, but would like to see core CPI ease before delivering a rate cut.US Dollar Shows Muted Reaction, US Stock Market Edges Higher After Inflation ReportThe US dollar is showing limited in the aftermath of today’s inflation report.

    "description": "BoE cuts rates to 4.0% in a split vote; Pound rises, FTSE falls. Growth fears outweigh inflation as Bailey signals gradual easing ahead.",
    "content": "The Bank of England (BOE) lowered the cash rate at today’s meeting by a quarter-point. This marks the second rate cut this year and brings the cash rate to 4.0%, its lowest level since March 2023. The British pound rose 0.50% after the rate decision.The BOE’s decision to lower rates was widely expected but the breakdown of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) vote was a huge surprise. The MPC had to hold a second vote in order to reach a decision, which had never happened before.In the end, the BoE decision was passed by the slimmest of margins. Out of nine MPC members, only five voted for a cut, with four favoring a quarter-point move and one voting for a deeper half-point cut. Four members voted to hold rates, which was a surprise as the markets had expected a larger majority for the quarter-point cut.Governor Bailey tried to put a positive spin on the razor-sharp vote, calling the decision “finely balanced”. Bailey said that future cuts would be “gradual and careful” and warned that it was crucial not to lower rates too quickly or too much.The close vote reflects the tensions that the BoE has to carefully navigate. The UK economy is sputtering as GDP contracted in May and June and the labor market is showing cracks as employers are cutting back on hiring due to higher payroll taxes and an increase in the minimum wages. At the same time, inflation, which hit 3.6% in June, has being moving higher and lowering rates will likely boost inflationary pressures.The BoE had made inflation its number one priority. However, today’s rate cut shows that the central bank is very concerned about the UK economy and is willing to cut rates, even if the cost is a further bump upwards in inflation. The rate statement said that the BoE remains focused on returning inflation sustainably to its 2% target” but today’s move indicates that achieving the 2% goal will take time.Top Forex Brokers1Get Started74% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRead ReviewBritish Pound Climbs Higher, Stock Market DeclinesThe BOE rate cut has extended the British Pound’s rally against the US Dollar. TheGBP/USD currency pairis up for a fifth straight day and is trading at 1.3422, up 0.56% on the day.

    "description": "US inflation remained at 2.7% in July as core CPI rose to 3.1%, reinforcing expectations of a September Fed rate cut and lifting US stocks.",
    "content": "The US consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-on-year in July, unchanged from the June figure and below the market estimate of 2.8%. CPI remained at its lowest annual inflation rate since February 2021. Monthly CPI eased, rising to 0.2% from 0.3%, in line with market expectations. Gasoline and fuel oil prices continued to decline sharply, a key factor in easing inflation.Core CPI, which excludes food and energy and is considered a better gauge of inflation trends, moved in the opposite direction. Annual CPI climbed to 3.1% in July, up from 2.9% and above the market estimate of 3.0%. This marked the highest level in five months. Monthly, the core rate rose 0.3%, up from 0.2% and in line with the market estimate.The rise in core CPI reflects the effect of Trump's tariffs, which took effect in April and continue to filter through the economy. The tariffs are expected to dampen growth and raise inflation, as US consumers pay more for imported goods.Inflation Report Likely Cements Rate Cut in SeptemberThe Federal Reserve has been on an extended pause and hasn't lowered interest rates since December 2024. That is expected to change at the next Fed meeting, barring an extreme surprise. The markets have currently priced in a 94% likelihood of a rate cut at the Sep. 17 meeting, up sharply from 84% just before the inflation release. Investors were clearly relieved that CPI remained at 2.7% and didn't rise to 2.8% as expected, anticipating that this will clear the path for the Fed to lower rates next month.US Dollar Shows Muted Response, Stock Market Edges Higher after Inflation ReportThe US dollar is showing little reaction following the release of the US inflation report, while the US stock market is in positive territory.TheGBP/USD currency pairis trading at 1.3482, up 0.35% on the day, but most of these gains were recorded ahead of the inflation release.The US stock market has posted gains on Tuesday, as investors reacted positively to the inflation report.TheS&P 500 Indexhas climbed 26 points (0.41%) and is trading at 6399.TheNasdaq 100 Indexhas climbed 86 points (0.36%) and is trading at 23,613.",
