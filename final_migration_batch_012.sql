Following the start of the Trump-Putin summit late last week, the EUR/USD pair recovered to the 1.1715 resistance level, close to its highest point in two weeks. Forecasters expect the euro to benefit if US President Donald Trump is able to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.The foreign exchange market''''s focus is on the meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where a significant breakthrough on a ceasefire is hoped for. A ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine would be a crucial turning point, as it could significantly strengthen the euro by boosting economic activity in the Eurozone through lower energy prices and improved consumer and business confidence. However, this is not a core expectation.It''''s unrealistic to expect a deal on Friday, but there''''s a strong possibility that it could pave the way for an eventual end to the conflict. According to performance across trusted trading platforms, with the euro rising by 12.75% against the US dollar by 2025, further gains are possible if geopolitical risks centered on Europe''''s eastern flank dissipate.Resolving the Ukraine Crisis Will Strengthen the EuroRussia''''s invasion of Ukraine marked a turning point for the European economy, which was highly dependent on Russian hydrocarbons.

So, whether or not we can keep up the momentum is a completely different question, but either way, I''''m at the very least not shorting this pair anytime soon.

('Weekly Pairs in Focus - August 03 - August 08, 2025 (Charts)', 'SilverSilver markets spent most of the week selling off, as we have seen a lot of volatility around the world. At this point, it’s worth noting that the US dollar sold off a bit but held firm against certain currencies. In other words, it looks like the volatility is only somewhat justified, and I think at this point in time it’s worth noting that the $36 level seems to be a significant support level just waiting to happen. If we can recapture the $37.50 level, we will probably reenter the range that we had been in during the previous month.GBP/USDThe British pound has plunged for most of the week, testing the crucial 1.32 region. However, we have found a little bit of support at the end of the week as the jobs number in the United States was horrible. This has the US dollar on the back foot just a little bit, but quite frankly, it has held its own fairly well, all things being considered. If we break down below the 50 Week EMA at the 1.3063 region, I suspect that the British pound will start to fall apart. If the British pound falls apart against the US dollar, the greenback probably swallows everything else right along with it.EUR/USDThe euro dropped fairly significantly during the course of the week to peek below the 1.15 level for a while but did recover a bit after the Non-Farm Payroll number came out of the United States much weaker than anticipated. This is an ugly candlestick regardless, so I do think this is a situation where if we get any follow-through whatsoever, namely a breakdown below the bottom of the weekly candlestick from the one that we just printed, the euro could be in serious trouble at that point. On the other hand, if we recapture the 1.16 level, then it’s likely that this pair will look likely to reach the 1.18 level eventually.Top Forex Brokers1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read ReviewBitcoinBitcoin has had a tough week, but quite frankly Bitcoin had been a little stretched.

('The Best War Stocks to Buy Now (Chart)', 'Defense stocks, also referred to as war stocks, are highly popular among professional portfolios, as they can protect the bottom line, staying true to their name. The primary customers of defense stocks are governments, which bring steady, long-term contracts, deep pockets, and a history of paying their bills on time. Pledges by NATO countries to boost defense spending provide a tailwind for earnings in the years ahead. Do you know what to look for in defense stocks?What Are War Stocks?War stocks, also known as defense stocks, refer to publicly listed companies that are actively engaged in the aerospace, space, and defense sectors. They form the backbone of defending sovereign countries and territories. Analysts expect demand to surge over the next decade, with global conflicts and geopolitical tensions rising.Why Should You Consider Investing in Defense Stocks?Defense stocks provide long-term, reliable income streams for companies. They outperform during market corrections and bear markets, as short-term economic cycles have a minimal impact on their business model.Despite popular opinion, conflicts do not move the price of defense stocks. There will be a short-term bounce, which usually falters. Investors must understand the long-term nature of defense stocks, where research and development (R&D) remain crucial. Conflicts boost demand for replenishing stockpiles and hardware, create opportunities to test new weapons platforms, and attract future buyers. Still, R&D and cybersecurity services are where defense stocks receive their best margins.Here are a few things to consider when evaluating defense stocks:The defense sector is seeking green alternatives, and stocks with a lead in sustainability could outperform peersFocus on defense stocks with excellent R&D capabilitiesCommunications, electronic warfare, and cybersecurity defense stocks provide ongoing revenue and have excellent growth ratesDefense stocks active in drone and anti-drone warfare rank among the fast', 'Broker Analysis', '2025-07-23T00:00:00', 'Stocks', ARRAY['stocks', 'equity markets'], 'the-best-war-stocks-to-buy-now-chart', 'Explore the best war stocks to buy now, including Lockheed Martin and Leidos Holdings.

While Brazil’s ruling government remains locked in a stubborn debate with the U.S White House, financial institutions apparently aren’t all that concerned. The USD/BRL is traversing long-term lows and is trading in a healthy correlation to other major currency pairs.While the USD/BRL traded around the 5.4000 ratio in early July, yesterday’s values however dropped below those early July marks when the 5.3800 level got some attention briefly. There isn’t a great amount of trading volume in the USD/BRL. The currency pair has not demonstrated a serious reversal higher over the past month, showing that financial institutions are comfortable within the lower values for the USD/BRL, spikes higher have been infrequent even with low volumes.Sustained Lows and Speculation in the USD/BRLThe ability of the USD/BRL to sustain lower price action and its trend downwards will prove intriguing to speculators.
